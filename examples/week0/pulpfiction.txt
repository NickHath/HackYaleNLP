1.      INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING                                      1.

        A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
        It's about 9:00 in the morning.  While the place isn't jammed,
        there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
        on bacon and eating eggs.

        Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN.  The
        Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like
        his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going
        out of style.

        It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how
        old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did.
        The boy and girl sit in a booth.  Their dialogue is to be said
        in a rapid-pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       No, forget it, it's too risky.  I'm
                       through doin' that shit.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       You always say that, the same thing
                       every time: never again, I'm
                       through, too dangerous.

                                   YOUNG MAN
                       I know that's what I always say.
                       I'm always right too, but --

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       -- but you forget about it in a day
                       or two --

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       -- yeah, well, the days of me
                       forgittin' are over, and the days
                       of me rememberin' have just begun.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       When you go on like this, you know
                       what you sound like?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       I sound like a sensible fucking
                       man, is what I sound like.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       You sound like a duck.
                            (imitates a duck)
                       Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
                       quack, quack...

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       Well take heart, 'cause you're
                       never gonna hafta hear it again.
                       Because since I'm never gonna do it
                       again, you're never gonna hafta
                       hear me quack about how I'm never
                       gonna do it again.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       After tonight.

        The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
        there, back and forth.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                            (with a smile)
                       Correct.  I got all tonight to
                       quack.

        A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

                                  WAITRESS
                       Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Oh yes, thank you.

        The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee.  The Young Man
        lights up another cigarette.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       I'm doin' fine. 
                      
        The Waitress leaves.  The Young Man takes a drag off of his
        smoke.  The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into
        her coffee.

        The Young Man goes right back into it.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       I mean the way it is now, you're
                       takin' the same fuckin' risk as
                       when you rob a bank.  You take more
                       of a risk.  Banks are easier!
                       Federal banks aren't supposed to
                       stop you anyway, during a robbery.
                       They're insured, why should they
                       care?  You don't even need a gun in
                       a federal bank.
                       I heard about this guy, walked into
                       a federal bank with a portable
                       phone, handed the phone to the
                       teller, the guy on the other end of
                       the phone said: "We got this guy's
                       little girl, and if you don't give
                       him all your money, we're gonna
                       kill 'er."

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Did it work?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       Fuckin' A it worked, that's what
                       I'm talkin' about!  Knucklehead
                       walks in a bank with a telephone,
                       not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a
                       fuckin' phone, cleans the place
                       out, and they don't lift a fuckin'
                       finger.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Did they hurt the little girl?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       I don't know.  There probably never
                       was a little girl -- the point of
                       the story isn't the little girl.
                       The point of the story is they
                       robbed the bank with a telephone.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       You wanna rob banks?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,
                       I'm just illustrating that if we
                       did, it would be easier than what
                       we been doin'.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       So you don't want to be a bank
                       robber?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       Naw, all those guys are goin' down
                       the same road, either dead or
                       servin' twenty.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       And no more liquor stores?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       What have we been talking about?
                       Yeah, no-more-liquor-stores.
                       Besides, it ain't the giggle it
                       usta be.  Too many foreigners own
                       liquor stores.  Vietnamese,
                       Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak
                       English.  You tell 'em: "Empty out
                       the register," and they don't know
                       what it fuckin' means.  They make
                       it too personal.  We keep on, one
                       of those gook motherfuckers' gonna
                       make us kill 'em.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       I'm not gonna kill anybody.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       I don't wanna kill anybody either.
                       But they'll probably put us in a
                       situation where it's us of them.
                       And if it's not the gooks, it these
                       old Jews who've owned the store for
                       fifteen fuckin' generations.  Ya
                       got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind
                       the counter with a fuckin' Magnum.
                       Try walkin' into one of those
                       stores with nothin' but a
                       telephone, see how far it gets you.
                       Fuck it, forget it, we're out of
                       it.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Well, what else is there, day jobs?

                                  YOUNG MAN
                            (laughing)
                       Not this life.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Well what then?

        He calls to the Waitress.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       Garcon!  Coffee!

        Then looks to his girl.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       This place.

        The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

                                  WAITRESS
                            (snotty)
                       "Garcon" means boy.

        She splits.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Here?  It's a coffee shop.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       What's wrong with that?  People
                       never rob restaurants, why not?
                       Bars, liquor stores, gas stations,
                       you get your head blown off
                       stickin' up one of them.
                       Restaurants, on the other hand, you
                       catch with their pants down.
                       They're not expecting to get
                       robbed, or not as expecting.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                            (taking to idea)
                       I bet in places like this you could 
                       cut down on the hero factor.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       Correct.  Just like banks, these
                       places are insured.  The managers
                       don't give a fuck, they're just
                       tryin' to get ya out the door
                       before you start pluggin' diners.
                       Waitresses, forget it, they ain't
                       takin' a bullet for the register.
                       Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid
                       a dollar fifty a hour gonna really
                       give a fuck you're stealin' from
                       the owner.  Customers are sittin'
                       there with food in their mouths,
                       they don't know what's goin' on.
                       One minute they're havin' a Denver
                       omelette, next minute somebody's
                       stickin' a gun in their face.

        The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea.  The Young Man
        continues in a low voice.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       See, I got the idea last liquor
                       store we stuck up.  'Member all
                       those customers kept comin' in?

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Yeah.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       They you got the idea to take
                       everybody's wallet.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Uh-huh.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       That was a good idea.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Thank you.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       We made more from the wallets then
                       we did the register.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Yes we did.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       A lot of people go to restaurants.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       A lot of wallets.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       Pretty smart, huh?

        The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new
        information.  She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in
        conversations.  The tires WAITRESS, taking orders.  The
        BUSBOYS going through the motions, collecting dishes.  The
        MANAGER complaining to the COOK about something.  A smiles
        breaks out on the Young Woman's face.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Pretty smart.
                            (into it)
                       I'm ready, let's go, right here,
                       right now.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       Remember, same as before, you're
                       crowd control, I handle the
                       employees.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       Got it.

        They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on
        the table.  He looks at her and she back at him.

                                  YOUNG WOMAN
                       I love you, Pumpkin.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                       I love you, Honey Bunny.

        And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,
        stand up and rob the restaurant.  Pumpkin's robbery persona is
        that of the in-control professional.  Honey Bunny's is that of
        the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

                                  PUMPKIN
                            (yelling to all)
                       Everybody be cool this is a
                       robbery!

                                  HONEY BUNNY
                       Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
                       I'll execute every one of you
                       motherfuckers!  Got that?

2.      INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) - MORNING                               2.

        An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down
        a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood.  In the front seat are
        two young fellas -- one white, one black -- both wearing cheap
        black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters.
        Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES WINNFIELD
        (black).  Jules is behind the wheel.

                                  JULES
                       -- okay now, tell me about the hash
                       bars?

                                  VINCENT
                       What so you want to know?

                                  JULES
                       Well, hash is legal there, right?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
                       hundred percent legal.  I mean you
                       can't walk into a restaurant, roll
                       a joint, and start puffin' away.
                       You're only supposed to smoke in
                       your home or certain designated
                       places.

                                  JULES
                       Those are hash bars?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah, it breaks down like this:
                       it's legal to buy it, it's legal to
                       own it and, if you're the
                       proprietor of a hash bar, it's
                       legal to sell it.  It's legal to
                       carry it, which doesn't really
                       matter 'cause -- get a load of this
                       -- if the cops stop you, it's
                       illegal for this to search you.
                       Searching you is a right that the
                       cops in Amsterdam don't have.

                                  JULES
                       That did it, man -- I'm fuckin'
                       goin', that's all there is to it.

                                  VINCENT
                       You'll dig it the most.  But you
                       know what the funniest thing about
                       Europe is?

                                  JULES
                       What?

                                  VINCENT
                       It's the little differences.  A
                       lotta the same shit we got here,
                       they got there, but there they're a
                       little different.

                                  JULES
                       Examples?

                                  VINCENT
                       Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy
                       beer in a movie theatre.  And I
                       don't mean in a paper cup either.
                       They give you a glass of beer, like
                       in a bar.  In Paris, you can buy
                       beer at MacDonald's.  Also, you
                       know what they call a Quarter
                       Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

                                  JULES
                       They don't call it a Quarter
                       Pounder with Cheese?

                                  VINCENT
                       No, they got the metric system
                       there, they wouldn't know what the
                       fuck a Quarter Pounder is.

                                  JULES
                       What'd they call it?

                                  VINCENT
                       Royale with Cheese.

                                  JULES
                            (repeating)
                       Royale with Cheese.  What'd they
                       call a Big Mac?

                                  VINCENT
                       Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
                       it Le Big Mac.

                                  JULES
                       What do they call a Whopper?

                                  VINCENT
                       I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
                       King.  But you know what they put
                       on french fries in Holland instead
                       of ketchup?

                                  JULES
                       What?

                                  VINCENT
                       Mayonnaise.

                                  JULES
                       Goddamn!

                                  VINCENT
                       I seen 'em do it.  And I don't mean
                       a little bit on the side of the
                       plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in
                       it.

                                  JULES
                       Uuccch!

3.      INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) - MORNING                                    3.

        The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach
        inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking
        them.

                                  JULES
                       We should have shotguns for this
                       kind of deal.

                                  VINCENT
                       How many up there?

                                  JULES
                       Three or four.

                                  VINCENT
                       Counting our guy?

                                  JULES
                       I'm not sure.

                                  VINCENT
                       So there could be five guys up
                       there?

                                  JULES
                       It's possible.

                                  VINCENT
                       We should have fuckin' shotguns.

        They CLOSE the trunk.

4.      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD - MORNING                     4.

        Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
        dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
        looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

        We TRACK alongside.

                                  VINCENT
                       What's her name?

                                  JULES
                       Mia.

                                  VINCENT
                       How did Marsellus and her meet?

                                  JULES
                       I dunno, however people meet
                       people.  She usta be an actress.

                                  VINCENT
                       She ever do anything I woulda saw?

                                  JULES
                       I think her biggest deal was she
                       starred in a pilot.

                                  VINCENT
                       What's a pilot?

                                  JULES
                       Well, you know the shows on TV?

                                  VINCENT
                       I don't watch TV.

                                  JULES
                       Yes, but you're aware that there's
                       an invention called television, and
                       on that invention they show shows?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah.

                                  JULES
                       Well, the way they pick the shows
                       on TV is they make one show, and
                       that show's called a pilot.  And
                       they show that one show to the
                       people who pick the shows, and on
                       the strength of that one show, they
                       decide if they want to make more
                       shows.  Some get accepted and
                       become TV programs, and some don't,
                       and become nothing.  She starred in
                       one of the ones that became
                       nothing.

        They enter the apartment building.


5.      INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) - MORNING              5.

        Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait for
        the elevator.

                                  JULES
                       You remember Antwan Rockamora?
                       Half-black, half-Samoan, usta call
                       him Tony Rocky Horror.

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah maybe, fat right?

                                  JULES
                       I wouldn't go so far as to call the
                       brother fat.  He's got a weight
                       problem.  What's the nigger gonna
                       do, he's Samoan.

                                  VINCENT
                       I think I know who you mean, what
                       about him?

                                  JULES
                       Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up
                       good.  And word around the
                       campfire, it was on account of
                       Marsellus Wallace's wife.

        The elevator arrives, the men step inside.


6.      INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING                                         6.

                                  VINCENT
                       What'd he do, fuck her?

                                  JULES
                       No no no no no no no, nothin' that
                       bad.

                                  VINCENT
                       Well what then?

                                  JULES
                       He gave her a foot massage.

                                  VINCENT
                       A foot massage?

        Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                  VINCENT
                       That's all?

        Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                  VINCENT
                       What did Marsellus do?

                                  JULES
                       Sent a couple of guys over to his
                       place.  They took him out on the
                       patio of his apartment, threw his
                       ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell
                       four stories.  They had this garden
                       at the bottom, enclosed in glass,
                       like one of them greenhouses --
                       nigger fell through that.  Since
                       then, he's kinda developed a speech
                       impediment.

        The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

                                  VINCENT
                       That's a damn shame.


7.      INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - MORNING                       7.

        STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline
        down the hall.

                                  VINCENT
                       Still I hafta say, play with
                       matches, ya get burned.

                                  JULES
                       Whaddya mean?

                                  VINCENT
                       You don't be givin' Marsellus
                       Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

                                  JULES
                       You don't think he overreacted?

                                  VINCENT
                       Antwan probably didn't expect
                       Marsellus to react like he did, but
                       he had to expect a reaction.

                                  JULES
                       It was a foot massage, a foot
                       massage is nothing, I give my
                       mother a foot massage.

                                  VINCENT
                       It's laying hands on Marsellus
                       Wallace's new wife in a familiar
                       way.  Is it as bad as eatin' her
                       out -- no, but you're in the same
                       fuckin' ballpark.

        Jules stops Vincent.

                                  JULES
                       Whoa...whoa...whoa...stop right
                       there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and
                       givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't
                       even the same fuckin' thing.

                                  VINCENT
                       Not the same thing, the same
                       ballpark.

                                  JULES
                       It ain't no ballpark either.  Look
                       maybe your method of massage
                       differs from mine, but touchin' his
                       lady's feet, and stickin' your
                       tongue in her holyiest of holyies,
                       ain't the same ballpark, ain't the
                       same league, ain't even the same
                       fuckin' sport.  Foot massages don't
                       mean shit.

                                  VINCENT
                       Have you ever given a foot massage?

                                  JULES
                       Don't be tellin' me about foot
                       massages -- I'm the fuckin' foot
                       master.

                                  VINCENT
                       Given a lot of 'em?

                                  JULES
                       Shit yeah.  I got my technique down
                       man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

                                  VINCENT
                       Have you ever given a guy a foot
                       massage?

        Jules looks at him a long moment -- he's been set up.

                                  JULES
                       Fuck you.

        He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a
        little bit behind.

                                  VINCENT
                       How many?

                                  JULES
                       Fuck you.

                                  VINCENT
                       Would you give me a foot massage --
                       I'm kinda tired.

                                  JULES
                       Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'
                       pissed -- this is the door.

        The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49."  They
        whisper.

                                  JULES
                       What time is it?

                                  VINCENT
                            (checking his watch)
                       Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

                                  JULES
                       It ain't quite time, let's hang
                       back.

        They move a little away from the door, facing each other,
        still whispering.

                                  JULES
                       Look, just because I wouldn't give
                       no man a foot massage, don't make
                       it right for Marsellus to throw
                       Antwan off a building into a glass-
                       motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the
                       way the nigger talks.  That ain't
                       right, man.  Motherfucker do that
                       to me, he better paralyze my ass,
                       'cause I'd kill'a motherfucker.

                                  VINCENT
                       I'm not sayin' he was right, but
                       you're sayin' a foot massage don't
                       mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it
                       does.  I've given a million ladies
                       a million foot massages and they
                       all meant somethin'.  We act like
                       they don't, but they do.  That's
                       what's so fuckin' cool about 'em.
                       This sensual thing's goin' on that
                       nobody's talkin about, but you know
                       it and she knows it, fuckin'
                       Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
                       shoulda known fuckin' better.
                       That's his fuckin' wife, man.  He
                       ain't gonna have a sense of humor
                       about that shit.

                                  JULES
                       That's an interesting point, but
                       let's get into character.

                                  VINCENT
                       What's her name again?

                                  JULES
                       Mia.  Why you so interested in big
                       man's wife?

                                  VINCENT
                       Well, Marsellus is leavin' for
                       Florida and when he's gone, he
                       wants me to take care of Mia.

                                  JULES
                       Take care of her?

        Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

                                  VINCENT
                       Not that!  Take her out.  Show her
                       a good time.  Don't let her get
                       lonely.

                                  JULES
                       You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace
                       out on a date?

                                  VINCENT
                       It ain't a date.  It's like when
                       you and your buddy's wife go to a
                       movie or somethin'.  It's just...
                       you know...good company.

        Jules just looks at him.

                                  VINCENT
                       It's not a date.

        Jules just looks at him.

                                  VINCENT
                       I'm not gonna be a bad boy.

        Jules shakes his head and mumbles to himself.

                                  JULES
                       Bitch gonna kill more niggers than
                       time.

                                  VINCENT
                       What was that?

                                  JULES
                       Nothin'.  Let's get into character.

                                  VINCENT
                       What'd you say?

                                  JULES
                       I didn't say shit.  Let's go to
                       work.

                                  VINCENT
                       Don't play with me, you said
                       somethin', now what was it?

                                  JULES
                            (referring to the job)
                       Do you wanna do this?

                                  VINCENT
                       I want you to repeat what you said.

                                  JULES
                       That door's gonna open in about
                       thirty seconds, so git yourself
                       together --

                                  VINCENT
                       -- my self is together --

                                  JULES
                       -- bullshit it is.  Stop thinkin'
                       'bout that Ho, and get yourself
                       together like a qualified pro.


8.      INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) - MORNING                              8.

        THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a
        table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

        One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to
        REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

                                  JULES
                       Hey kids.

        The two men stroll inside.

        The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

        MARVIN
        The black young man, who open the door, will, as the scene
        progresses, back into the corner.

        ROGER
        A young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of Seagulls"
        haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the table with a
        big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

        BRETT
        A white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

        Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in their
        pockets.  Jules is the one who does the talking.

                                  JULES
                       How you boys doin'?

        No answer.

                                  JULES
                            (to Brett)
                       Am I trippin', or did I just ask
                       you a question.

                                  BRETT
                       We're doin' okay.

        As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

                                  JULES
                       Do you know who we are?

        Brett shakes his head: "No."

                                  JULES
                       We're associates of your business
                       partner Marsellus Wallace, you
                       remember your business partner
                       dont'ya?

        No answer.

                                  JULES
                            (to Brett)
                       Now I'm gonna take a wild guess
                       here: you're Brett, right?

                                  BRETT
                       I'm Brett.

                                  JULES
                       I thought so.  Well, you remember
                       your business partner Marsellus
                       Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

                                  BRETT
                       I remember him.

                                  JULES
                       Good for you.  Looks like me and
                       Vincent caught you at breakfast,
                       sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

                                  BRETT
                       Hamburgers.

                                  JULES
                       Hamburgers.  The cornerstone of any
                       nutritious breakfast.  What kinda
                       hamburgers?

                                  BRETT
                       Cheeseburgers.

                                  JULES
                       No, I mean where did you get'em?
                       MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
                       Box, where?

                                  BRETT
                       Big Kahuna Burger.

                                  JULES
                       Big Kahuna Burger.  That's that
                       Hawaiian burger joint.  I heard
                       they got some tasty burgers.  I
                       ain't never had one myself, how are
                       they?

                                  BRETT
                       They're good.

                                  JULES
                       Mind if I try one of yours?

                                  BRETT
                       No.

                                  JULES
                       Yours is this one, right?

                                  BRETT
                       Yeah.

        Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

                                  JULES
                       Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
                            (to Vincent)
                       Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
                       Burger?

                                  VINCENT
                       No.

        Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

                                  JULES
                       You wanna bite, they're real good.

                                  VINCENT
                       I ain't hungry.

                                  JULES
                       Well, if you like hamburgers give
                       'em a try sometime.  Me, I can't
                       usually eat 'em 'cause my
                       girlfriend's a vegetarian.  Which
                       more or less makes me a vegetarian,
                       but I sure love the taste of a good
                       burger.
                            (to Brett)
                       You know what they call a Quarter
                       Pounder with Cheese in France?

                                  BRETT
                       No.

                                  JULES
                       Tell 'em, Vincent.

                                  VINCENT
                       Royale with Cheese.

                                  JULES
                       Royale with Cheese, you know why
                       they call it that?

                                  BRETT
                       Because of the metric system?

                                  JULES
                       Check out the big brain on Brett.
                       You'a smart motherfucker, that's
                       right.  The metric system.
                            (he points to a fast
                              food drink cup)
                       What's in this?

                                  BRETT
                       Sprite.

                                  JULES
                       Sprite, good, mind if I have some
                       of your tasty beverage to wash this
                       down with?

                                  BRETT
                       Sure.

        Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

                                  JULES
                       Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
                            (to Roger)
                       You, Flock of Seagulls, you know
                       what we're here for?

        Roger nods his head: "Yes."

                                  JULES
                       Then why don't you tell my boy here
                       Vince, where you got the shit hid.

                                  MARVIN
                       It's under the be --

                                  JULES
                       -- I don't remember askin' you a
                       goddamn thing.
                            (to Roger)
                       You were sayin'?

                                  ROGER
                       It's under the bed.

        Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out a
        black snap briefcase.

                                  VINCENT
                       Got it.

        Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case.  We can't see
        what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case.  Vincent
        just stares at it, transfixed.

                                  JULES
                       We happy?

        No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

                                  JULES
                       Vincent!

        Vincent looks up at Jules.

                                  JULES
                       We happy?

        Closing the case.

                                  VINCENT
                       We're happy.

                                  BRETT
                            (to Jules)
                       Look, what's your name?  I got his
                       name's Vincent, but what's yours?

                                  JULES
                       My name's Pitt, and you ain't
                       talkin' your ass outta this shit.

                                  BRETT
                       I just want you to know how sorry
                       we are about how fucked up things
                       got between us and Mr. Wallace.
                       When we entered into this thing, we
                       only had the best intentions --

        As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger three
        times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

        Vince smiles to himself.  Jules has got style.

        Brett has just shit his pants.  He's not crying or whimpering,
        but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

                                  JULES
                            (to Brett)
                       Oh, I'm sorry.  Did that break your
                       concentration?  I didn't mean to do
                       that.  Please, continue.  I believe
                       you were saying something about
                       "best intentions."

        Brett can't say a word.

                                  JULES
                       Whatsamatter?  Oh, you were through
                       anyway.  Well, let me retort.
                       Would you describe for me what
                       Marsellus Wallace looks like?

        Brett still can't speak.

        Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing
        the only barrier between himself and Brett.  Brett now sits in
        a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in front
        of an interrogator.

                                  JULES
                       What country you from!

                                  BRETT
                            (petrified)
                       What?

                                  JULES
                       "What" ain't no country I know!  Do
                       they speak English in "What?"

                                  BRETT
                            (near heart attack)
                       What?

                                  JULES
                       English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
                       it?

                                  BRETT
                       Yes.

                                  JULES
                       Then you understand what I'm
                       sayin'?

                                  BRETT
                       Yes.

                                  JULES
                       Now describe what Marsellus Wallace
                       looks like!

                                  BRETT
                            (out of fear)
                       What?

        Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's
        cheek.

                                  JULES
                       Say "What" again!  C'mon, say
                       "What" again!  I dare ya, I double
                       dare ya motherfucker, say "What"
                       one more goddamn time!

        Brett is regressing on the spot.

                                  JULES
                       Now describe to me what Marsellus
                       Wallace looks like!

        Brett does his best.

                                  BRETT
                       Well he's ...he's...black --

                                  JULES
                       -- go on!

                                  BRETT
                       ...and he's...he's...tall --

                                  JULES
                       -- does he look like a bitch?!

                                  BRETT
                            (without thinking)
                       What?

        Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his
        eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

        Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in the
        chair.

                                  JULES
                       Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

                                  BRETT
                            (in agony)
                       No.

                                  JULES
                       Then why did you try to fuck 'im
                       like a bitch?!

                                  BRETT
                            (in spasm)
                       I didn't.

        Now in a lower voice.

                                  JULES
                       Yes ya did Brett.  Ya tried ta fuck
                       'im.  You ever read the Bible,
                       Brett?

                                  BRETT
                            (in spasm)
                       Yes.

                                  JULES
                       There's a passage I got memorized,
                       seems appropriate for this
                       situation: Ezekiel 25:17. "The path
                       of the righteous man is beset on
                       all sides by the inequities of the
                       selfish and the tyranny of evil
                       men.  Blessed is he who, in the
                       name of charity and good will,
                       shepherds the weak through the
                       valley of darkness, for he is truly
                       his brother's keeper and the finder
                       of lost children.  And I will
                       strike down upon thee with great
                       vengeance and furious anger those
                       who attempt to poison and destroy
                       my brothers.  And you will know my
                       name is the Lord when I lay my
                       vengeance upon you."

        The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting
        Brett.

        When they are finished, the bullet-ridden carcass just sits
        there for a moment, then TOPPLES over.

        All is quiet.

        The only SOUND is Marvin MUTTERING in the corner.

                                  MARVIN
                       ...goddamn...goddamn...that was
                       fucked up...goddamn, that was cold-
                       blooded...

                                  VINCENT
                            (pointing to Marvin)
                       Friend of yours?

                                  JULES
                       Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-
                       Marvin.

                                  VINCENT
                       Tell 'em to shut up, he's gettin'
                       on my nerves.

                                  JULES
                       Marvin, I'd knock that shit off if
                       I was you.

        Then suddenly the bathroom door BURSTS OPEN, and a FOURTH MAN
        (as young as the rest) comes CHARGING out, a silver Magnum in
        his hand.

        We DOLLY into a MEDIUM on him.

                                  FOURTH MAN
                       Die...die...die...die...die...die!

        The Fourth Man FIRES SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his hand cannon in
        the direction of Vincent and Jules.  He SCREAMS a maniacal cry
        of revenge until he's DRY FIRING.

        Then...his face does a complete change of expression.  It goes
        from a "Vengeance is mine" expression, to a "What the fuck"
        blank look.

                                  FOURTH MAN
                       I don't understand --

        The Fourth Man is BLOWN OFF HIS FEET and OUT OF FRAME by
        bullets that TEAR HIM TO SHREDS.

        He leaves the FRAME EMPTY.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK

        Against black, TITLE CARD:

9.      MEDIUM SHOT - BUTCH COOLIDGE                                    9.
        We FADE UP on Butch Coolidge, a white, 26-year-old
        prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue
        high school athletic jacket.  Talking to him OFF SCREEN is
        everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE.  The black man sounds like
        a cross between a gangster and a king.

                                  MARSELLUS (OS)
                       I think you're gonna find -- when
                       all this shit is over and done -- I
                       think you're gonna find yourself
                       one smilin' motherfucker.  Thing is
                       Butch, right now you got ability.
                       But painful as it may be, ability
                       don't last.  Now that's a hard
                       motherfuckin' fact of life, but
                       it's a fact of life your ass is
                       gonna hafta git realistic about.
                       This business is filled to the brim
                       with unrealistic motherfuckers who
                       thought their ass aged like wine.
                       Besides, even if you went all the
                       way, what would you be?  Feather-
                       weight champion of the world.  Who
                       gives a shit?  I doubt you can even
                       get a credit card based on that.

        A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front of
        Butch.  Butch picks it up.

                                  MARSELLUS (OS)
                       Now the night of the fight, you may
                       fell a slight sting, that's pride
                       fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride!  Pride
                       only hurts, it never helps.  Fight
                       through that shit.  'Cause a year
                       from now, when you're kickin' it in
                       the Caribbean you're gonna say,
                       "Marsellus Wallace was right."

                                  BUTCH
                       I got no problem with that.

                                  MARSELLUS (OS)
                       In the fifth, your ass goes down.

        Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                  MARSELLUS (OS)
                       Say it!

                                  BUTCH
                       In the fifth, my ass goes down.

10.     INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY                                         10.

        Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964
        cherry-red Chevy Malibu convertible.  From the car radio,
        ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS.  The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.


11.     EXT. SALLY LeROY'S - DAY                                        11.

        Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bat by LAX that Marsellus
        owns.

        Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking lot
        and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

        Vince knocks on the door.  The front entrance is unlocked,
        revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside:  ENGLISH DAVE.
        Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin
        Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally
        LeRoy's.

                                  ENGLISH DAVE
                       Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,
                       git your ass on in here.

        Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between
        Vincent and Jules, steps inside.  English Dave SLAMS the door
        in our faces.


12.     INT. SALLY LeROY'S - DAY                                        12.

        The spacious club is empty this time of day.  English Dave
        crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

                                  VINCENT
                       Where's the big man?

                                  ENGLISH DAVE
                       He's over there, finishing up some
                       business.

        VINCENT'S POV:
        Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with his back to us.
        The huge figure is the infamous and as of yet still UNSEEN
        Marsellus.

                                  ENGLISH DAVE (OS)
                       Hand back for a second or two, and
                       when you see the white boy leave,
                       go on over.  In the meanwhile, can
                       I make you an espresso?

                                  VINCENT
                       How 'bout a cup of just plain ol'
                       American?

                                  ENGLISH DAVE
                       Comin' up.  I hear you're taking
                       Mia out tomorrow?

                                  VINCENT
                       At Marsellus' request.

                                  ENGLISH DAVE
                       Have you met Mia?

                                  VINCENT
                       Not yet.

        English Dave smiles to himself.

                                  VINCENT
                       What's so funny?

                                  ENGLISH DAVE
                       Not a goddamn thing.

                                  VINCENT
                       Look, I'm not a idiot.  She's the
                       big man's fuckin' wife.  I'm gonna
                       sit across a table, chew my food
                       with my mouth closed, laugh at her
                       jokes and that's all I'm gonna do.

        English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

                                  ENGLISH DAVE
                       My name's Paul, and this is between
                       y'all.

        Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his cup
        of "plain ol' American."

                                  BUTCH
                            (to English Dave)
                       Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

                                  ENGLISH DAVE
                       Filters?

                                  BUTCH
                       Non.

        While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his
        coffee, staring at him.  Butch looks over at him.

                                  BUTCH
                       Lookin' at somethin', friend?

                                  VINCENT
                       I ain't your friend, palooka.

        Butch does a slow burn toward Vincent.

                                  BUTCH
                       What was that?

                                  VINCENT
                       I think ya heard me just fine,
                       punchy.

        Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

                                  MARSELLUS (OS)
                       Vincent Vega has entered the
                       building, git your ass over here!

        Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another
        glance.  We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME,
        looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching
        business.

        BUTCH'S POV:
        Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure that is
        Marsellus.

        Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend
        of Marsellus, he better let it go -- for now.

                                  ENGLISH DAVE (OS)
                       Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

        Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts.  He pays
        English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

13.     INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - NIGHT                            13.

        CU JODY
        a woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings.  Both of
        her ears are pierced five times.  She also sports rings in her
        lips, eyebrows and nose.

                                  JODY
                       ...I'll lend it to you.  It's a
                       great book on body piercing.

        Jody, Vincent and a young woman names TRUDI sit at the kitchen
        table of a suburban house in Echo Park.  Even though Vince is
        at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

                                  TRUDI
                       You know how they use that gun when
                       they pierce your ears?  They don't
                       use that when they pierce your
                       nipples, do they?

                                  JODY
                       Forget that gun.  That gun goes
                       against the entire idea behind
                       piercing.  All of my piercing,
                       sixteen places on my body, every
                       one of 'em done with a needle.
                       Five in each ear.  One through the
                       nipple on my left breast.  One
                       through my right nostril.  One
                       through my left eyebrow.  One
                       through my lip.  One in my clit.
                       And I wear a stud in my tongue.

        Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear
        and out the other, until that last remark.

                                  VINCENT
                            (interrupting)
                       Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.  I'm
                       curious, why would you get a stud
                       in your tongue?

        Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious
        thing in the world.

                                  JODY
                       It's a sex thing.  It helps
                       fellatio.

        That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it
        makes sense.  Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent
        to ponder the truth of her statement.

        Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two
        continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

        CU - THE NEEDLE
        going into Vincent's vein.

        CU - BLOOD
        spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.

        CU OF VINCENT'S THUMB
        pushing down on the plunger.

                                                        CUT TO:

15.     EXT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                          15.

        Vincent walks up to the driveway leading to Marsellus
        Wallace's front door.  When he gets to the door, he hears
        MUSIC on the other side, and a note in plain view taped to it.
        He rips it off.

        CU - NOTE

                        "Hi Vincent,

                        I'm getting dressed.  The door's
                        open.  Come inside and make
                        yourself a drink.

                                            Mia"

        Vincent neatly folds the note up, sticks it in his pocket,
        takes a here-goes-nothing breath and turns the knob.


16.     INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                          16.

        As Vincent steps inside, the MUSIC that was behind the door,
        SWELLS drastically.  Vincent, hands in pockets, strolls
        inside, checking out his boss' home.

                                  VINCENT
                            (yelling)
                       Hello!  I'm here!

        We hear a DOOR OPEN, Vincent turns in its direction.


17.     INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                                      17.

        We're inside the room where the MUSIC is PLAYING.  In the f.g.
        MIA WALLACE, naked with her back to us, talks to Vincent
        through a crack in the door.  The door shields the front of
        her body from Vincent.

                                  MIA
                       Vincent Vega?

                                  VINCENT
                       I'm Vincent, you Mia?

                                  MIA
                       That's me, pleased to meetcha.  I'm
                       still getting dressed.  To your
                       left, past the kitchen, is a bar.
                       Why don't you make yourself a
                       drink, have a seat in the living
                       room, and I'll be out within three
                       shakes of a lamb's tail.

                                  VINCENT
                       Take your time.

        Mia closes the door.  Before she can fully turn around and
        show us her face...

                                                        WE CUT:

        BACK TO VINCENT
        standing where he was, MUSIC beating, looking at the closed
        door.  We slowly ZOOM to the door.

        We slowly ZOOM from a MEDIUM SHOT to CU on Vincent as he
        contemplates what's on the other side of the door.  When we
        reach a CU, he walks OUT OF FRAME, breaking the spell.

        Vincent walks to the bar and pours himself a drink.

        WE JUXTAPOSE
        as the MUSIC plays.

        Mia's dress selection is taken out of the closet.

        Vincent, drink in hand, moves into the living room.

        Mia, her back to CAMERA, dressed in her pretty dress, checks
        herself in the mirror.  We DOLLY towards her.  Her face is
        still obscured.

        CU - PORTRAIT OF MIA
        hanging on the living room wall, showing Mia sensually
        reclining on a couch.

        CU - Mia cutting a huge line of coke on her vanity table with

        Vincent sits on a plush, comfy couch.

        CU - MIA'S NOSE
        snorting the line from a rolled up dollar bill.

        Vincent on the couch, drink in hand.  The SONG abruptly CUTS
        OFF.

        CU - CD PLAYER OPENING
        Mia's hand comes in and takes the CD out.

        The CAMERA follows behind Mia's bare feet as she walks out of
        the dressing room, through the dining room, through the
        kitchen and into the living room.

        SHOT THROUGH A VIDEO CAMERA
        Mia has a camcorder and is videotaping Vincent on the couch.
        He looks up and sees her.

                                  MIA (OS)
                       Smile, you're on Mia's camera!

                                  VINCENT
                       Ready to go?

                                  MIA (OS)
                       Not yet.  I'm going to interview you
                       first.  Are you any relation to
                       Suzanne Vega?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah, she's my cousin.

                                  MIA (OS)
                       Suzanne Vega the folk singer is
                       your cousin?

                                  VINCENT
                       Suzanne Vega's my cousin.  If she's
                       become a folk singer, I sure as
                       hell don't know nothin' about it.
                       But then I haven't been to too many
                       Thanksgivings lately.

                                  MIA (OS)
                       Now I'm gonna ask you a bunch of
                       quick questions I've come up with
                       that more of less tell me what kind
                       of person I'm having dinner with.
                       My theory is that when it comes to
                       important subjects, there's only
                       two ways a person can answer.  For
                       instance, there's two kinds of
                       people in this world, Elvis people
                       and Beatles people.  Now Beatles
                       people can like Elvis.  And Elvis
                       people can like the Beatles.  But
                       nobody likes them both equally.
                       Somewhere you have to make a
                       choice.  And that choice tells me
                       who you are.

                                  VINCENT
                       I can dig it.

                                  MIA (OS)
                       I knew you could.  First question,
                       Brady Bunch or the Partridge
                       Family?

                                  VINCENT
                       The Partridge Family all the way,
                       no comparison.

                                  MIA (OS)
                       On "Rich Man, Poor Man," who did
                       you like, Peter Strauss or Nick
                       Nolte?

                                  VINCENT
                       Nick Nolte, of course.

                                  MIA (OS)
                       Are you a "Bewitched" man, or a
                       "Jeannie" man?

                                  VINCENT
                       "Bewitched," all the way, though I
                       always dug how Jeannie always
                       called Larry Hagman "master."

                                  MIA (OS)
                       If you were "Archie," who would you
                       fuck first, Betty or Veronica?

                                  VINCENT
                       Betty.  I never understood Veronica
                       attraction.

                                  MIA (OS)
                       Have you ever fantasized about
                       being beaten up by a girl?

                                  VINCENT
                       Sure.

                                  MIA (OS)
                       Who?

                                  VINCENT
                       Emma Peel on "The Avengers."  That
                       tough girl who usta hang out with
                       Encyclopedia Brown.  And Arlene

                       Who's Arlene Motika?

                                  VINCENT
                       Girl from sixth grade, you don't
                       know her.

        CU - MIA
        lowers the camcorder from in front of her face and we get our
        first full-on look at her.  When we do, we get a pretty good
        idea why Marsellus feels the way he does.  She breaks out in a
        blinding smile.

18.     EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S - NIGHT                                  18.

        In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over LA,
        giving Thai restaurants a run for their money.  They're all
        basically the same.  Decor out of an "Archie" comic book,
        Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,
        saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the
        Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelette, and
        over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

        But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's
        diners.  Either the best or the worst, depending on your point
        of view.

        Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant.  A big sign with
        a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red
        windbreaker towers over the establishment.  Underneath the
        cartoon is the name:  JACKRABBIT SLIM'S.  Underneath that is
        the slogan:  "Next best thing to a time machine."


19.     INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S - NIGHT                                  19.

        Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint
        English pub.  Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over the
        wall ("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF
        THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY").  The booths that
        the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s
        cars.

        In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor.  A big sign
        on the wall states, "No shoes allowed."  So wannabe beboppers
        (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or
        barefeet.

        The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,
        B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them.  The
        WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:
        MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and
        LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing
        appropriate costumes.

        Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red
        '59 Edsel.  BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting a
        big button on his chest that says:  "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing
        you please me."

                                  BUDDY
                       Hi I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

                                  VINCENT
                       I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

                                  BUDDY
                       How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,
                       or bloody as hell?

                                  VINCENT
                       Bloody as hell.  And to drink, a
                       vanilla coke.

                                  BUDDY
                       How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

                                  MIA
                       I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger
                       -- bloody -- and a five-dollar
                       shake.

                                  BUDDY
                       How d'ya want that shake, Martin
                       and Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

                                  MIA
                       Martin and Lewis.

                                  VINCENT
                       Did you just order a five-dollar
                       shake?

                                  MIA
                       Sure did.

                                  VINCENT
                       A shake?  Milk and ice cream?

                                  MIA
                       Uh-huh.

                                  VINCENT
                       It costs five dollars?

                                  BUDDY
                       Yep.

                                  VINCENT
                       You don't put bourbon in it or
                       anything?

                                  BUDDY
                       Nope.

                                  VINCENT
                       Just checking.

        Buddy exits.

        Vincent takes a look around the place.  The YUPPIES are
        dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and
        the icons are playing their parts.  Marilyn is squealing, The
        Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her
        customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a
        fool.

                                  MIA
                       Whaddya think?

                                  VINCENT
                       It's like a wax museum with a pulse
                       rate.

        Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling
        himself a smoke.

        After a second of watching him --

                                  MIA
                       What are you doing?

                                  VINCENT
                       Rollin' a smoke.

                                  MIA
                       Here?

                                  VINCENT
                       It's just tobacco.

                                  MIA
                       Oh.  Well in that case, will you
                       roll me one, cowboy?

        As he finishes licking it --

                                  VINCENT
                       You can have his one, cowgirl.

        He hands her the rolled smoke.  She takes it, putting it to
        her lips.  Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's
        hand.  He lights it.

                                  MIA
                       Thanks.

                                  VINCENT
                       Think nothing of it.

        He begins rolling one for himself.

        As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,
        making everything SHAKE and RATTLE.  Marilyn Monroe runs to a
        square vent in the floor.  An imaginary subway train BLOWS the
        skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a
        squeal.  The entire restaurant applauds.

        Back to Mia and Vincent

                                  MIA
                       Marsellus said you just got back
                       from Amsterdam.

                                  VINCENT
                       Sure did.  I heard you did a pilot.

                                  MIA
                       That was my fifteen minutes.

                                  VINCENT
                       What was it?

                                  MIA
                       It was show about a team of female
                       secret agents called "Fox Force
                       Five."

                                  VINCENT
                       What?

                                  MIA
                       "Fox Force Five."  Fox, as in we're
                       a bunch of foxy chicks.  Force, as
                       in we're a force to be reckoned
                       with.  Five, as in there's one..two
                       ..three..four..five of us.  There
                       was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal
                       from that show "Baton Rouge," she
                       was the leader.  A Japanese one, a
                       black one, a French one and a
                       brunette one, me.  We all had
                       special skills.  Sommerset had a
                       photographic memory, the Japanese
                       fox was a kung fu master, the black
                       girl was a demolition expert, the
                       French fox' specialty was sex...

                                  VINCENT
                       What was your specialty?

                                  MIA
                       Knives.  The character I played,
                       Raven McCoy, her background was she
                       was raised by circus performers.
                       So she grew up doing a knife act.
                       According to the show, she was the
                       deadliest woman in the world with a
                       knife.
                       But because she grew up in a
                       circus, she was also something of
                       an acrobat.  She could do
                       illusions, she was a trapeze artist
                       -- when you're keeping the world
                       safe from evil, you never know when
                       being a trapeze artist's gonna come
                       in handy.  And she knew a zillion
                       old jokes her grandfather, an old
                       vaudevillian, taught her.  If we 
                       woulda got picked up, they woulda
                       worked in a gimmick where every
                       episode I woulda told and ol joke.

                                  VINCENT
                       Do you remember any of the jokes?

                                  MIA
                       Well I only got the chance to say
                       one, 'cause we only did one show.

                                  VINCENT
                       Tell me.

                                  MIA
                       No.  It's really corny.

                                  VINCENT
                       C'mon, don't be that way.

                                  MIA
                       No.  You won't like it and I'll be
                       embarrassed.

                                  VINCENT
                       You told it in front of fifty
                       million people and you can't tell
                       it to me?  I promise I won't laugh.

                                  MIA
                            (laughing)
                       That's what I'm afraid of.

                                  VINCENT
                       That's not what I meant and you
                       know it.

                                  MIA
                       You're quite the silver tongue
                       devil, aren't you?

                                  VINCENT
                       I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

                                  MIA
                       That's not what you said Vince.
                       Well now I'm definitely not gonna
                       tell ya, 'cause it's been built up
                       too much.

                                  VINCENT
                       What a gyp.

        Buddy comes back with the drinks.  Mia wraps her lips around
        the straw of her shake.

                                  MIA
                       Yummy!

                                  VINCENT
                       Can I have a sip of that?  I'd like
                       to know what a five-dollar shake
                       tastes like.

                                  MIA
                       Be my guest.

        She slides the shake over to him.

                                  MIA
                       You can use my straw, I don't have
                       kooties.

        Vincent smiles.

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah, but maybe I do.

                                  MIA
                       Kooties I can handle.

        He takes a sip.

                                  VINCENT
                      Goddamn!  That's a pretty fuckin'
                      good milk shake.

                                  MIA
                      Told ya.

                                  VINCENT
                      I don't know if it's worth five
                      dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'
                      good.

        He slides the shake back.

        Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

                                  MIA
                       Don't you hate that?

                                  VINCENT
                       What?

                                  MIA
                       Uncomfortable silences.  Why do we
                       feel it's necessary to yak about
                       bullshit in order to be
                       comfortable?

                                  VINCENT
                       I don't know.

                                  MIA
                       That's when you know you found
                       somebody special.  When you can
                       just shit the fuck up for a minute,
                       and comfortably share silence.

                                  VINCENT
                       I don't think we're there yet.  But
                       don't feel bad, we just met each
                       other.

                                  MIA
                       Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to
                       the bathroom and powder my nose,
                       while you sit here and think of
                       something to say.

                                  VINCENT
                       I'll do that.


20.     INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) - NIGHT                    20.

        Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the
        bathroom sink.  Her head jerks up from the rush.

                                  MIA
                            (imitating Steppenwolf)
                       I said goddamn!


21.     INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) - NIGHT                    21.

        Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak.  As he chews, his
        eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

        Mia comes back to the table.

                                  MIA
                       Don't you love it when you go to
                       the bathroom and you come back to
                       find your food waiting for you?

                                  VINCENT
                       We're lucky we got it at all.
                       Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much
                       of a waiter.  We shoulda sat in
                       Marilyn Monroe's section.

                                  MIA
                       Which one, there's two Marilyn
                       Monroes.

                                  VINCENT
                       No there's not.

        Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

                                  VINCENT
                       That's Marilyn Monroe...

        Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and
        capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS --

                                  VINCENT
                       ...and that's Mamie Van Doren.  I
                       don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it
                       must be her night off.

                                  MIA
                       Pretty smart.

                                  VINCENT
                       I have moments.

                                  MIA
                       Did ya think of something to say?

                                  VINCENT
                       Actually, there's something I've
                       wanted to ask you about, but you
                       seem like a nice person, and I
                       didn't want to offend you.

                                  MIA
                       Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like
                       mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
                       you chit-chat.  This sounds like
                       you actually have something to say.

                                  VINCENT
                       Only if you promise not to get
                       offended.

                                  MIA
                       You can't promise something like
                       that.  I have no idea what you're
                       gonna ask.  You could ask me what
                       you're gonna ask me, and my natural
                       response could be to be offended.
                       Then, through no fault of my own, I
                       woulda broken my promise.

                                  VINCENT
                       Then let's just forget it.

                                  MIA
                       That is an impossibility.  Trying
                       to forget anything as intriguing as
                       this would be an exercise in
                       futility.

                                  VINCENT
                       Is that a fact?

        Mia nods her head: "Yes."

                                  MIA
                       Besides, it's more exciting when
                       you don't have permission.

                                  VINCENT
                       What do you think about what
                       happened to Antwan?

                                  MIA
                       Who's Antwan?

                                  VINCENT
                       Tony Rocky Horror.

                                  MIA
                       He fell out of a window.

                                  VINCENT
                       That's one way to say it.  Another
                       way is, he was thrown out.  Another
                       was is, he was thrown out by
                       Marsellus.  And even another way
                       is, he was thrown out of a window
                       by Marsellus because of you.

                                  MIA
                       Is that a fact?

                                  VINCENT
                       No it's not, it's just what I
                       heard.

                                  MIA
                       Who told you this?

                                  VINCENT
                       They.

        Mia and Vincent smile.

                                  MIA
                       They talk a lot, don't they?

                                  VINCENT
                       They certainly do.

                                  MIA
                       Well don't by shy Vincent, what
                       exactly did they say?

        Vincent is slow to answer

                                  MIA
                       Let me help you Bashful, did it
                       involve the F-word?

                                  VINCENT
                       No.  They just said Rocky Horror
                       gave you a foot massage.

                                  MIA
                       And...?

                                  VINCENT
                       No and, that's it.

                                  MIA
                       You heard Marsellus threw Rocky
                       Horror out of a four-story window
                       because he massaged my feet?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah.

                                  MIA
                       And you believed that?

                                  VINCENT
                       At the time I was told, it seemed
                       reasonable.

                                  MIA
                       Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
                       four-story window for giving me a
                       foot massage seemed reasonable?

                                  VINCENT
                       No, it seemed excessive.  But that
                       doesn't mean it didn't happen.  I
                       heard Marsellus is very protective
                       of you.

                                  MIA
                       A husband being protective of his
                       wife is one thing.  A husband
                       almost killing another man for
                       touching his wife's feet is
                       something else.

                                  VINCENT
                       But did it happen?

                                  MIA
                       The only thing Antwan ever touched
                       of mine was my hand, when he shook
                       it.  I met Anwan once -- at my
                       wedding -- then never again.  The
                       truth is, nobody knows why
                       Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror
                       out of that window except Marsellus
                       and Tony Rocky Horror.  But when
                       you scamps get together, you're
                       worse than a sewing circle.

                                  VINCENT
                       Are you mad?

                                  MIA
                       Not at all.  Being the subject of
                       back-fence gossip goes with the
                       right, I guess.

        She takes a sip of her five-dollar shake, and says:

                                  MIA
                       Thanks.

                                  VINCENT
                       What for?

                                  MIA
                       Asking my side.

        At that moment, a great oldie-but-goodie BLASTS from the
        jukebox.

                                  MIA
                       I wanna dance.

                                  VINCENT
                       I'm not much of a dancer.

                                  MIA
                       Now I'm the one gettin' gyped.  I
                       do believe Marsellus told you to
                       take me out and do whatever I
                       wanted.  Well, now I want to dance.

        Vincent smiles and begins taking off his boots.  Mia
        triumphantly casts hers off.  He takes her hand, escorting her
        to the dance floor.  The two face each other for that brief
        moment before you begin to dance, than they both break into a
        devilish twist.  Mia's version of the twist is that of a sexy
        cat.  Vincent is pure Mr. Cool as he gets into a hip-
        swivelling rhythm that would make Mr. Checker proud.

        The OTHER DANCERS on the floor are trying to do the same
        thing, but Vincent and Mia seem to be strangely shaking their
        asses in sync.  The two definitely share a rhythm and share
        smiles as they SING ALONG with the last verse of the Golden
        Oldie.

                                                        CUT TO:

22.     INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME - NIGHT                           22.

        The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
        style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the
        previous scene.  They finish their little dance, laughing.

        Then...

        The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

                                  VINCENT
                       Was than an uncomfortable silence?

                                  MIA
                       I don't know what that was.
                            (pause)
                       Music and drinks!

        Mia moves away to attend to both.  Vincent hangs up his
        overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

                                  VINCENT
                       I'm gonna take a piss.

                                  MIA
                       That was a little bit more
                       information than I needed to know,
                       but for right ahead.

        Vincent shuffles off to the john.

        Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs and
        selects one: k.d. lang.  The speakers BLAST OUT a high energy
        country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to.  She dances her
        way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's overcoat
        hanging on the rack.  She touches its sleeve.  It feels good.

        Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
        Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on
        some rolling paper.  Imitating what he did earlier, licks the
        paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette.  Maybe a
        little too fat, but not bad for a first try.  Mia thinks so
        anyway.  Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his
        Zippo lighter.  She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, trying
        to light it fancy-style like Vince did.  What do you know, she
        did it!  Mia's one happy clam.  She triumphantly brings the
        fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then LOUDLY
        SNAPS the Zippo closed.

        The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
        takes a long, cool drag.  Her hand slides the Zippo back in
        the overcoat pocket.  But wait, her fingers touch something
        else.  Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
        inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.
        Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
        face.

                                  MIA
                            (like you would say
                              Bingo!)
                       Disco!  Vince, you little cola nut,
                       you've been holding out on me.

                                                        CUT TO:

23.     INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) - NIGHT               23.

        Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to
        himself in the mirror.

                                  VINCENT
                       One drink and leave.  Don't be
                       rude, but drink your drink quickly,
                       say goodbye, walk out the door, get
                       in your car, and go down the road.

        LIVING ROOM

        Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines on
        her glass top coffee table.  Taking her trusty hundred dollar
        bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the fat
        line.

        CU - MIA
        her head JERKS back.  Her hands go to her nose (which feels
        like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.
        Then...the rush hits...

        BATHROOM

        Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his
        dialogue with the mirror.

                                  VINCENT
                       ...it's a moral test of yourself,
                       whether or not you can maintain
                       loyalty.  Because when people are
                       loyal to each other, that's very
                       meaningful.

        LIVING ROOM

        Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but it's
        like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from her
        knees.  Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose.  Then her
        stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

        BATHROOM

        Vince continues.

                                  VINCENT
                       So you're gonna go out there, drink
                       your drink, say "Goodnight, I've
                       had a very lovely evening," go
                       home, and jack off.  And that's all
                       you're gonna do.

        Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's ready
        for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of that door.
        So he goes through it.

        LIVING ROOM

        We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the
        living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like a rag
        doll.  She's twisted on her back.  Blood and puke are down her
        front.  And her face is contorted.  Not out of the tightness
        of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her face are so
        relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.  Slack-
        jawed.

                                  VINCENT
                       Jesus Christ!

        Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.
        Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck
        to check her pulse.  She slightly stirs.

        Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

                                  VINCENT
                            (sounding weird)
                       Mia!  Mia!  What the hell happened?

        But she's unable to communicate.  Mia makes a few lost
        mumbles, but they're not distinctive enough to be called
        words.

        Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

                                  VINCENT
                            (to himself)
                       I'll be a sonofabitch.
                            (to Mia)
                       Mia!  Mia!  What did you take?
                       Answer me honey, what did you take?

        Mia is incapable of answering.  He SLAPS her face hard.

        Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the
        rack.  He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY.  It's gone.
        Vincent makes a beeline to Mia.  We follow.

                                  VINCENT
                            (yelling to Mia)
                       Okay honey, we're getting you on
                       your feet.

        He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

                                  VINCENT
                       We're on our feet now, and now
                       we're gonna talk out to the car.
                       Here we go, watch us walk.

        We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
        unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.


24.     EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) - NIGHT                         24.

        INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

        Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws,
        speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.


25.     INT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) - NIGHT                         25.

        Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting like
        Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when he
        glances over at Mia.

        Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag of
        water.

        Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket.  He punches
        a number.


26.     INT. LANCE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      26.

        At this late hour, Lance has transformed from a bon vivant
        drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

        He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-out
        but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT,
        CALIFORNIA," and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe.  In his hand
        is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries.  In front of
        him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n
        Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in an
        ashtray.
        On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three
        Stooges, and they're getting married.

                                  PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
                            (on TV)
                       Hold hands, you love birds.

        The phone RINGS.

        Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

        It RINGS again.

        Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

                                  JODY (OS)
                       Lance!  The phone's ringing!

                                  LANCE
                            (calling back)
                       I can hear it!

                                  JODY (OS)
                       I thought you told those fuckin'
                       assholes never to call this late!

                                  LANCE
                            (by the phone)
                       I told 'em and that's what I'm
                       gonna tell this fuckin' asshole
                       right now!
                            (he answers the phone)
                       Hello, do you know how late it is?
                       You're not supposed to be callin'
                       me this fuckin' late.

        BACK TO VINCENT IN THE MALIBU
        Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching
        the phone to his ear.  WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the
        conversation.

                                  VINCENT
                       Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big
                       fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way
                       to your place.

                                  LANCE
                       Whoa, hold you horses man, what's
                       the problem?

                                  VINCENT
                       You still got an adrenalin shot?

                                  LANCE
                            (dawning on him)
                       Maybe.

                                  VINCENT
                       I need it man, I got a chick she's
                       fuckin' O.D.ing on me.

                                  LANCE
                       Don't bring her here!  I'm not even
                       fuckin' joking with you, don't you
                       be bringing some fucked up pooh-
                       butt to my house!

                                  VINCENT
                       No choice.

                                  LANCE
                       She's O.D.in'?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah.  She's dyin'.

                                  LANCE
                       Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take
                       'er to a hospital and call a
                       lawyer!

                                  VINCENT
                       Negative.

                                  LANCE
                       She ain't my fuckin' problem, you
                       fucked her up, you deal with it --
                       are you talkin' to me on a cellular
                       phone?

                                  VINCENT
                       Sorry.

                                  LANCE
                       I don't know you, who is this,
                       don't come here, I'm hangin' up.

                                  VINCENT
                       Too late, I'm already here.

        At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR Vincent's Malibu
        coming up the street.  Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his
        curtains and YANKS the cord.  The curtains open with a WHOOSH
        in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn
        and CRASHING into his house.  THe window Lance is looking out
        of SHATTERS from the impact.

                                  JODY (OS)
                       What the hell was that?

        Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front lawn.


27.     EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      27.

        Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia out.

                                  LANCE
                       Have you lost your mind?!  You
                       crashed your car in my fuckin'
                       house!  You talk about drug shit on
                       a cellular fuckin' phone --

                                  VINCENT
                       If you're through havin' your
                       little hissy fit, this chick is
                       dyin', get your needle and git it
                       now!

                                  LANCE
                       Are you deaf?  You're not bringin'
                       that fucked up bitch in my house!

                                  VINCENT
                       This fucked up bitch is Marsellus
                       Wallace's wife.  Now if she fuckin'
                       croaks on me, I'm a grease spot.
                       But before he turns me into a bar
                       soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell
                       'im about how you coulda saved her
                       life, but instead you let her die
                       on your front lawn.


28.     INT. LANCE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                      28.

        WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

        Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up.  She's
        wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone on
        it.

        We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking
        through the hall into the living room.

                                  JODY
                       It's only one-thirty in the goddamn
                       mornin'!  What the fuck's goin' on
                       out here?

        As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance
        standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of
        the room.

        From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a
        DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference here
        being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

                                  JODY
                       Who's she?

        Lance looks up at Jody.

                                  LANCE
                       Get that black box in the bedroom I
                       have with the adrenalin shot.

                                  JODY
                       What's wrong with her?

                                  VINCENT
                       She's O.D.ing on us.

                                  JODY
                       Well get her the hell outta here!

                                  LANCE AND VINCENT
                            (in stereo)
                       Get the fuckin' shot!

                                  JODY
                       Don't yell and me!

        She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking for
        the shot.

        WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

                                  VINCENT
                            (to Lance)
                       You two are a match made in heaven.

                                  LANCE
                       Look, just keep talkin' to her,
                       okay?  While she's gettin' the
                       shot, I gotta get a medical book.

                                  VINCENT
                       What do you need a medical book
                       for?

                                  LANCE
                       To tell me how to do it.  I've
                       never given an adrenalin shot
                       before.

                                  VINCENT
                       You've had that thing for six years
                       and you never used it?

                                  LANCE
                       I never had to use it.  I don't go
                       joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers,
                       all of my  friends can handle their
                       highs!

                                  VINCENT
                       Well then get it.

                                  LANCE
                       I am, if you'll let me.

                                  VINCENT
                       I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

                                  LANCE
                       Stop talkin' to me, and start
                       talkin' to her.

        WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...


29.     SPARE ROOM                                                      29.
        with a bunch of junk in it.  He frantically starts scanning
        the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words,
        "Come on," endlessly.

        From OFF SCREEN we hear:

                                  VINCENT (OS)
                       Hurry up man!  We're losin' her!

                                  LANCE
                            (calling back)
                       I'm looking as fast as I can!

        Lance continues his frenzied search.

        WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

                                  JODY (OS)
                       What's he lookin' for?

                                  VINCENT (OS)
                       I dunno, some medical book.

        Jody calls to Lance.

                                  JODY (OS)
                       What are you lookin' for?

                                  LANCE
                       My black medical book!

        As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,
        Jody appears in the doorway.

                                  JODY
                       Whata re you looking for?

                                  LANCE
                       My black fuckin' medical book.
                       It's like a text book they give to
                       nurses.

                                  JODY
                       I never saw a medical book.

                                  LANCE
                       Trust me, I have one.

                                  JODY
                       Well if it's that important, why
                       didn't you keep it with the shot?

        Lance spins toward her.

                                  LANCE
                       I don't know!  Stop bothering me!

                                  JODY
                       While you're lookin' for it, that
                       girl's gonna die on our carpet.
                       You're never gonna find it in all
                       this shit.  For six months now,
                       I've been telling you to clean this
                       room --

                                  VINCENT (OS)
                       -- get your ass in here, fuck the
                       book!

        Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT
        heading for the living room.


30.     LIVING ROOM                                                     30.
        Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance
        reenters the room.

                                  VINCENT
                       Quit fuckin' around man and give
                       her the shot!

        Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody.  He
        opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

                                  LANCE
                       While I'm doing this, take her
                       shirt off and find her heart.

        Vince rips her blouse open.

        Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

                                  VINCENT
                       Does it have to be exact?

                                  LANCE
                       Yeah, it has to be exact!  I'm
                       giving her an injection in the
                       heart, so I gotta exactly hit her
                       in the heart.

                                  VINCENT
                       Well, I don't know exactly where
                       her heart is, I think it's here.

        Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and
        nods.

                                  LANCE
                       That's it.

        As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

                                  VINCENT
                       I need a big fat magic marker, got
                       one?

                                  JODY
                       What?

                                  VINCENT
                       I need a big fat magic marker, any
                       felt pen'll do, but a magic marker
                       would be great.

                                  JODY
                       Hold on.

        Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her
        enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents
        of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

        The injection is ready.  Lance hands Vincent the needle.

                                  LANCE
                       It's ready, I'll tell you what to
                       do.

                                  VINCENT
                       You're gonna give her the shot.

                                  LANCE
                       No, you're gonna give her the shot.

                                  VINCENT
                       I've never does this before.

                                  LANCE
                       I've never does this before either,
                       and I ain't starting now.  You
                       brought 'er here, that means you
                       give her the shot.  The day I bring
                       an O.D.ing bitch to your place,
                       then I gotta give her the shot.

        Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic
        marker in her hand.

                                  JODY
                       Got it.

        Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes a
        big red dot in Mia's body where her heart is.

                                  VINCENT
                       Okay, what do I do?

                                  LANCE
                       Well, you're giving her an
                       injection of adrenalin straight to
                       her heart.  But she's got a breast
                       plate in front of her heart, so you
                       gotta pierce through that.  So what
                       you gotta do is bring the needle
                       down in a stabbing motion.

        Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The
        Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN."

                                  VINCENT
                       I gotta stab her?

                                  LANCE
                       If you want the needle to pierce
                       through to her heart, you gotta
                       stab her hard.  Then once you do,
                       push down on the plunger.

                                  VINCENT
                       What happens after that?

                                  LANCE
                       I'm curious about that myself.

                                  VINCENT
                       This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

                                  LANCE
                       She's supposed to come out of it
                       like --
                            (snaps his fingers)
                       -- that.

        Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing
        motion.  He looks down on Mia.

        Mia is fading fast.  Soon nothing will help her.

        Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

                                  VINCENT
                       Count to three.

        Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know what
        to expect.

                                  LANCE
                       One...

        RED DOT on Mia's body.

        Needle raised ready to strike.

                                  LANCE (OS)
                       ...two...

        Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

        NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

                                  LANCE (OS)
                       ...three!

        The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

        Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the
        chest.

        Mia's head if JOLTED from the impact.

        The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenalin out
        through the needle.

        Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of the
        banshee.  She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck in
        her chest -- SCREAMING.

        Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in
        front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

        Mia's scream runs out.  She slowly starts taking breaths of
        air.

        The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken
        to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

                                  LANCE
                       If you're okay, say something.

        Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a
        relatively normal voice.

                                  MIA
                       Something.

        Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and
        shaking from how close to death Mia came.

                                  JODY
                       Anybody want a beer?

                                                        CUT TO:

31.     INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) - NIGHT                          31.

        Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home.  No one says
        anything, both are still too shaken.


32.     EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                 32.

        The Malibu pulls up to the front.  Mia gets out without saying
        a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway
        toward her front door.

                                  VINCENT (OS)
                       Mia!

        She turns around.

        Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big
        distance between the two.

                                  VINCENT
                       What are your thoughts on how to
                       handle this?

                                  MIA
                       What's yours?

                                  VINCENT
                       Well I'm of the opinion that
                       Marsellus can live his whole live
                       and never ever hear of this
                       incident.

        Mia smiles.

                                  MIA
                       Don't worry about it.  If Marsellus
                       ever heard of this, I'd be in as
                       much trouble as you.

                                  VINCENT
                       I seriously doubt that.

                                  MIA
                       If you can keep a secret, so can I.

                                  VINCENT
                       Let's shake on it.

        The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to
        shake and shake they do.

                                  VINCENT
                       Mum's the word.

        Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
        evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

        Vincent smiles.

                                  VINCENT
                       If you'll excuse me, I gotta go
                       home and have a heart attack.

        Mia giggles.

        Vincent turns to leave.

                                  MIA
                       You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE
                       FIVE" joke?

        Vincent turns around.

                                  VINCENT
                       Sure, but I think I'm still a
                       little too petrified to laugh.

                                  MIA
                       Uh-huh.  You won't laugh because
                       it's not funny.  But if you still
                       wanna hear it, I'll tell it.

                                  VINCENT
                       I can't wait.

                       tomato, and a little baby tomato.
                       The baby tomato is lagging behind
                       the poppa and momma tomato.  The
                       poppa tomato gets mad, goes over to
                       the momma tomato and stamps on
                       him --
                            (STAMPS on the ground)

        They both smile, but neither laugh.

                       See ya 'round, Vince.

        Mia turns and walks inside her house.

        CU - VINCENT
        after Mia walks inside.  Vincent continues to look at where
        she was.  He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a

        BUTCH'S POV
        We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in
        Alhambra, California, in the year 1972.
        BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish, stands in the doorway leading into the
        living room.  Next to her is a man dressed in the uniform of
        an American Air Force officer.  The CAMERA is the perspective
        of a five-year old boy.

                                  MOTHER
                       Butch, stop watching TV a second.
                       We got a special visitor.  Now do
                       you remember when I told you your
                       daddy dies in a P.O.W. camp?

                                  BUTCH (OS)
                       Uh-huh.

                                  MOTHER
                       Well this here is Capt. Koons.  He
                       was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

        CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and
        bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's
        eyeline.  When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas
        accent.

                                  CAPT. KOONS
                       Hello, little man.  Boy I sure
                       heard a bunch about you.  See, I
                       was a good friend of your Daddy's.
                       We were in that Hanoi pit of hell
                       over five years together.
                       Hopefully, you'll never have to
                       experience this yourself, but when
                       two men are in a situation like me
                       and your Daddy were, for as long as
                       we were, you take on certain
                       responsibilities of the other.  If
                       it had been me who had not made it,
                       Major Coolidge would be talkin'
                       right now to my son Jim.  But the
                       way it worked out is I'm talkin' to
                       you, Butch.  I got somethin' for
                       ya.

        The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

                                  CAPT. KOONS
                       This watch I got here was first
                       purchased by your great-granddaddy.
                       It was bought during the First
                       World War in a little general store
                       in Knoxville, Tennessee.  It was
                       bought by private Doughboy Ernie
                       Coolidge the day he set sail for
                       Paris.  It was your great-
                       granddaddy's war watch, made by the
                       first company to ever make wrist
                       watches.  You see, up until then,
                       people just carried pocket watches.
                       Your great-granddaddy wore that
                       watch every day he was in the war.
                       Then when he had done his duty, he
                       went home to your great-
                       grandmother, took the watch off his
                       wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
                       can.  And in that can it stayed
                       'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge
                       was called upon by his country to
                       go overseas and fight the Germans
                       once again.  This time they called
                       it World War Two.
                       Your great-granddaddy gave it to
                       your granddad for good luck.
                       Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't
                       as good as his old man's.  Your
                       granddad was a Marine and he was
                       killed with all the other Marines
                       at the battle of Wake Island.  Your
                       granddad was facing death and he
                       knew it.  None of those boys had
                       any illusions about ever leavin'
                       that island alive.  So three days
                       before the Japanese took the
                       island, your 22-year old
                       grandfather asked a gunner on an
                       Air Force transport named Winocki,
                       a man he had never met before in
                       his life, to deliver to his infant
                       son, who he had never seen in the
                       flesh, his gold watch.  Three days
                       later, your grandfather was dead.
                       But Winocki kept his word.  After
                       the war was over, he paid a visit
                       to your grandmother, delivering to
                       your infant father, his Dad's gold
                       watch.  This watch.  This watch was
                       on your Daddy's wrist when he was
                       shot down over Hanoi.  He was
                       captured and put in a Vietnamese
                       prison camp.  Now he knew if the
                       gooks ever saw the watch it's be
                       confiscated.  The way your Daddy
                       looked at it, that watch was your
                       birthright.  And he'd be damned if
                       and slopeheads were gonna put their
                       greasy yella hands on his boy's
                       birthright.  So he hid it in the
                       one place he knew he could hide
                       somethin'.  His ass.  Five long
                       years, he wore this watch up his
                       ass.  Then when he died of
                       disentary, he gave me the watch.  I
                       hid with uncomfortable hunk of
                       metal up my ass for two years.
                       Then, after seven years, I was sent
                       home to my family.  And now, little
                       man, I give the watch to you.

        Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch.  A little hand comes
        into FRAME to accept it.

                                                        CUT TO:

34.     INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT                                        34.

        The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:
        trunks, shoes and gloves.  He lies on a table catching a few
        zzzzzz's before his big fight.  Almost as soon as WE CUT to
        him, he wakes up with a start.  Shaken by the bizarre memory,
        he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

        His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a
        little, sticking his head in the room.  Pandemonium seems to
        be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

                                  KLONDIKE
                       It's time, Butch.

                                  BUTCH
                       I'm ready.

        Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB
        outside.  He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook.
        Butch hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps
        him on with the robe, which says on the back:  "BATTLING BUTCH
        COOLIDGE."

        The two men head for the door.  Klondike opens the door for
        Butch.  As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes
        apeshit.  Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in
        the quiet, empty locker room.

                       -- well Dan, that had to be the
                       bloodiest and, hands-down, the most
                       brutal fight this city has ever
                       seen.

        The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.


        FADE IN:

35.     EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) - NIGHT                                    35.

        A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium.  The
        sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN.  WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked
        car.  The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from
        inside.

                                  SPORTSCASTER #1 (OS)
                       ...Coolidge was out of there faster
                       than I've ever seen a victorious
                       boxer vacate the ring.  Do you
                       think he knew Willis was dead?

                                  SPORTSCASTER #2 (OS)
                       My guess would be yes, Richard.  I
                       could see from my position here,
                       the frenzy in his eyes give way to
                       the realization of what he was
                       doing.  I think any man would've
                       left the ring that fast.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

36.     INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) - NIGHT                              38.

        Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named
        ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS.  A young woman, with Spanish looks, sits
        parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a white
        styrofoam cup.

        The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

                       Do you feel this ring death tragedy
                       will have an effect on the world of
                       boxing?

                                  SPORTSCASTER #2 (OS)
                       Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't
                       help but shake the world of boxing
                       to its very foundation.  But it's
                       of paramount importance that during
                       the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of
                       the W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on
                       the -- CLICK --

        Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

        She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in
        the alley.  She sticks her head out of the car door to see:


37.     A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-side
        of the alley.  A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster
        below the window.  Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed in
        boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to the
        dumpster below.

        ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

        Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS to
        the taxi.  Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and
        throws it to the ground.


38.     INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) - NIGHT                              38.

        Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves,
        HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

        Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through the
        rearview mirror:

                                  ESMARELDA
                            (Spanish accent)
                       Are you the man I was supposed to
                       pick up?

                                  BUTCH
                       If you're the cab I called, I'm the
                       guy you're supposed to pick up.

                                  ESMARELDA
                       Where to?

                                  BUTCH
                       Outta here.

        The ignition key is TWISTED.  The engine ROARS to life.

        The meter is FLIPPED on.

        Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.


39.     EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) - NIGHT                        39.

        The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet
        pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.


40.     INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) - NIGHT                    40.

        Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through
        the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,
        shutting the door on the madness.  Once inside, English Dave
        takes time to adjust his suit and tie.

        In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table --
        dead.  His face looks like he went dunking for bees.  His
        TRAINER is on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over
        the body.

        The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,
        hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.  We
        still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

        Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

        Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

                                  MARSELLUS (OS)
                       What'cha got?

                                  ENGLISH DAVE
                       He booked.

                                  MARSELLUS (OS)
                       I'm prepared to scour the earth for
                       this motherfucker.  If Butch goes
                       to Indo China, I want a nigger
                       hidin' in a bowl of rice, ready to
                       pop a cap in his ass.

                                  ENGLISH DAVE
                       I'll take care of it.

41.     INT. CAB (MOVING/RAINING) - NIGHT                               41.

        Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

        Esmarelda watches in the rearview mirror.

        He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't
        find the roll bar.

                                  BUTCH
                       Hey, how do I open the window back
                       here?

                                  ESMARELDA
                       I have to do it.

        She presses a button and the back window moves down.  Butch
        tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying
        the other one.

        Esmarelda can't keep quiet anymore.

                                  ESMARELDA
                       Hey, mister?

                                  BUTCH
                            (still working on the
                              glove)
                       What?

                                  ESMARELDA
                       You were in that fight?  The fight
                       on the radio -- you're the fighter?

        As he tosses his other glove out the window.

                                  BUTCH
                       Whatever gave you that idea?

                                  ESMARELDA
                       No c'mon, you're him, I know you're
                       him, tell me you're him.

                                  BUTCH
                            (drying himself with a
                              gym towel)
                       I'm him.

                                  ESMARELDA
                       You killed the other boxing man.

                                  BUTCH
                       He's dead?

                                  ESMARELDA
                       The radio said he was dead.

        He finished wiping himself down.

                                  BUTCH
                            (to himself)
                       Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

        He tosses the towel out the window.

        Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a tee-shirt.

                                  ESMARELDA
                       What does it feel like?

                                  BUTCH
                            (finds his shirt)
                       What does what feel like?

                                  ESMARELDA
                       Killing a man.  Beating another man
                       to death with your bare hands.

        Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

                                  BUTCH
                       Are you some kinda weirdo?

                                  ESMARELDA
                       No, it's a subject I have much
                       interest in.  You are the first
                       person I ever met who has killed
                       somebody.  So, what was it like to
                       kill a man?

                                  BUTCH
                       Tell ya what, you give me one of
                       them cigarettes, I'll give you an
                       answer.

        Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitment.

                                  ESMARELDA
                       Deal!

        Butch leans forward.  Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,
        passes a cigarette back to him.  He takes it.  Then, still not
        looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in it.
        Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

        He takes a long drag.

                                  BUTCH
                       So....

        He looks at her license

                                  BUTCH
                       ...Esmarelda Villalobos -- is that
                       Mexican?

                                  ESMARELDA
                       The name is Spanish, but I'm
                       Columbian.

                                  BUTCH
                       It's a very pretty name.

                                  ESMARELDA
                       It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

                                  BUTCH
                       That's one hell of a name you got
                       there, sister.

                                  ESMARELDA
                       Thank you.  And what is your name?

                                  BUTCH
                       Butch.

                                  ESMARELDA
                       Butch.  What does it mean?

                                  BUTCH
                       I'm an American, our names don't
                       mean shit.  Anyway, moving right
                       along, what is it you wanna know,
                       Esmarelda?

                                  ESMARELDA
                       I want to know what it feels like
                       to kill a man --

                                  BUTCH
                       -- I couldn't tell ya.  I didn't
                       know he was dead 'til you told me
                       he was dead.  Now I know he's dead,
                       do you wanna know how I feel about
                       it?

        Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

                                  BUTCH
                       I don't feel the least little bit
                       bad.  You wanna know why,
                       Esmarelda?

        Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

                                  BUTCH
                       'Cause I'm a boxer.  And after
                       you've said that, you've said
                       pretty much all there is to say
                       about me.  Now maybe that son-of-a-
                       bitch tonight was once at one time
                       a boxer.  If he was, then he was
                       dead before his ass ever stepped in
                       the ring.  I just put the poor
                       bastard outta his misery.  And if
                       he never was a boxer --
                            (Butch takes a drag)
                       That's what he gets for fuckin' up
                       my sport.


42.     EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) - NIGHT                              42.

        We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

                                  BUTCH
                            (into phone)
                       What's I tell ya, soon as the word
                       got out a fix was in, the odds
                       would be outta control.
                       Hey, if he was a better fighter
                       he's be alive.  If he never laced
                       up his gloves in the first place,
                       which he never shoulda done, he'd
                       be alive.  Enough about the poor
                       unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's talk
                       about the rich and prosperous Mr.
                       Butch.  How many bookies you spread
                       it around with?
                            (pause)
                       Eight?  How long to collect?
                            (pause)
                       So by tomorrow evening, you'll have
                       it all?
                            (pause)
                       Good news Scotty, real good news --
                       I understand a few stragglers
                       aside.  Me an' Fabian're gonna
                       leave in the morning.  It should
                       take us a couple days to get into
                       Knoxville.  Next time we see each
                       other, it'll be on Tennessee time.

        Butch hangs up the phone.  He looks at the cab waiting to take
        him wherever he wants to go.

                                  BUTCH
                            (to himself in French
                              with English
                              subtitles)
                       Fabian my love, our adventure
                       begins.

                                                        CUT TO:

43.     EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED RAINING) - NIGHT                            43.

        Esmarelda's tax pulled into the motel parking lot.  The rain
        has stopped, but the night is still soaked.  Butch gets out,
        now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic
        jacket.  He leans in the driver's side window.

                                  ESMARELDA
                       Forty-five sixty.

        Handing her the money.

                                  BUTCH
                       Merci beaucoup.  And here's a
                       little something for the effort.

        Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

        Esmarelda's eyes light up.  She goes to take it.  Butch holds
        it out of reach.

                                  BUTCH
                       Now if anybody should ask you about
                       who your fare was tonight, what're
                       you gonna tell 'em?

                                  ESMARELDA
                       The truth.  Three well-dressed,
                       slightly toasted, Mexicans.

        He gives her the bill.

                                  BUTCH
                       Bon soir, Esmarelda.

                                  ESMARELDA
                            (in Spanish)
                       Sleep well, Butch.

        He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.
        She drives off.


44.     INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) - NIGHT                                   44.

        Butch enters and turns on the light.

        Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to us
        is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIAN.

                                  FABIAN
                       Keep the light off.

        Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

                                  BUTCH
                       Is that better, sugar pop?

                                  FABIAN
                       Oui.  Hard day at the office?

                                  BUTCH
                       Pretty hard.  I got into a fight.

                                  FABIAN
                       Poor baby.  Can we make spoons?

        Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabian from behind.

        When Butch and Fabian speak to each other, they speak in baby-
        talk.

                                  FABIAN
                       I was looking at myself in the
                       mirror.

                                  BUTCH
                       Uh-huh?

                                  FABIAN
                       I wish I had a pot.

                                  BUTCH
                       You were lookin' in the mirror and
                       you wish you had some pot?

                                  FABIAN
                       A pot.  A pot belly.  Pot bellies
                       are sexy.

                                  BUTCH
                       Well you should be happy, 'cause
                       you do.

                                  FABIAN
                       Shut up, Fatso!  I don't have a
                       pot!  I have a bit of a tummy, like
                       Madonna when she did "Lucky Star,"
                       it's not the same thing.

                                  BUTCH
                       I didn't realize there was a
                       difference between a tummy and a
                       pot belly.

                                  FABIAN
                       The difference is huge.

                                  BUTCH
                       You want me to have a pot?

                                  FABIAN
                       No.  Pot bellies make a man look
                       either oafish, or like a gorilla.
                       But on a woman, a pot belly is very
                       sexy.  The rest of you is normal.
                       Normal face, normal legs, normal
                       hips, normal ass, but with a big,
                       perfectly round pot belly.  If I
                       had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two
                       sizes too small to accentuate it.

                                  BUTCH
                       You think guys would find that
                       attractive?

                                  FABIAN
                       I don't give a damn what men find
                       attractive.  It's unfortunate what
                       we find pleasing to the touch and
                       pleasing to the eye is seldom the
                       same.

                                  BUTCH
                       If I had a pot belly, I'd punch you
                       in it.

                                  FABIAN
                       You'd punch me in my belly?

                                  BUTCH
                       Right in the belly.

                                  FABIAN
                       I'd smother you.  I'd drop it on
                       your right on your face 'til you
                       couldn't breathe.

                                  BUTCH
                       You'd do that to me?

                                  FABIAN
                       Yes!

                                  BUTCH
                       Did you get everything, sugar pop?

                                  FABIAN
                       Yes, I did.

                                  BUTCH
                       Good job.

                                  FABIAN
                       Did everything go as planned?

                                  BUTCH
                       You didn't listen to the radio?

                                  FABIAN
                       I never listen to your fights.
                       Were you the winner?

                                  BUTCH
                       I won alright.

                                  FABIAN
                       Are you still retiring?

                                  BUTCH
                       Sure am.

                                  FABIAN
                       What about the man you fought?

                                  BUTCH
                       Floyd retired too.

                                  FABIAN
                            (smiling)
                       Really?!  He won't be fighting no
                       more?!

                                  BUTCH
                       Not no more.

                                  FABIAN
                       So it all worked out in the finish?

                                  BUTCH
                       We ain't at the finish, baby.

        Fabian rolls over and Butch gets on top of her.  They kiss.

                                  FABIAN
                       We're in a lot of danger, aren't
                       we?

        Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                  FABIAN
                       If they find us, they'll kill us,
                       won't they?

        Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                  FABIAN
                       But they won't find us, will they?

        Butch nods his head: "no."

                                  FABIAN
                       Do you still want me to go with
                       you?

        Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                  FABIAN
                       I don't want to be a burden or a
                       nuisance --

        Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her
        crotch.

        Fabian reacts.

                                  FABIAN
                       Say it!

                                  BUTCH
                       Fabian, I want you to be with me.

                                  FABIAN
                       Forever?

                                  BUTCH
                       ...and ever.

        Fabian lies her head back.

        Butch continues to massage her crotch.

                                  FABIAN
                       Do you love me?

                                  BUTCH
                       Oui.

                                  FABIAN
                       Butch?  Will you give me oral
                       pleasure?

        Butch kisses her on the mouth.

                                  BUTCH
                       Will you kiss it?

        She nods her head: "yes."

                                  FABIAN
                       But you first.

        Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral
        pleasure.  Fabian's face is alone in the frame.

                                  FABIAN
                            (in French, with
                              English subtitles)
                       Butch my love, the adventure
                       begins

                                                        FADE TO BLACK

        FADE UP:

45.     MOTEL ROOM                                                      45.

        Same motel room, except empty.  WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in
        the bathroom.  The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway.  We
        see Fabian in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow
        her up.  She's drying her head with a towel.  Butch is inside
        the shower washing up.  We see the outline of his naked body
        through the smoky glass of the shower door.  Steam fills the
        bathroom.  Butch turns the shower off and opens the door,
        popping his head out.

                                  BUTCH
                       I think I cracked a rib.

                                  FABIAN
                       Giving me oral pleasure?

                                  BUTCH
                       No retard, from the fight.

                                  FABIAN
                       Don't call me retard.

                                  BUTCH
                            (in a Mongoloid voice)
                       My name is Fabby!  My name is
                       Fabby!

                                  FABIAN
                       Shut up fuck head!  I hate that
                       Mongoloid voice.

                                  BUTCH
                       Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take
                       it back!  Can I have a towel
                       please, Miss Beautiful Tulip.

                                  FABIAN
                       Oh I like that, I like being called
                       a tulip.  Tulip is much better than
                       Mongoloid.

        She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban
        on her head.

                                  BUTCH
                       I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I
                       called you a retard, but I took it
                       back.

        She hands him a towel.

                                  BUTCH
                       Merci beaucoup.

                                  FABIAN
                       Butch?

                                  BUTCH
                            (drying his head)
                       Yes, lemon pie.

                                  FABIAN
                       Where are we going to go?

                                  BUTCH
                       I'm not sure yet.  Wherever you
                       want.  We're gonna get a lot of
                       money from this.  But it ain't
                       gonna be so much, we can live like
                       hogs in the fat house forever.  I
                       was thinking we could go somewhere
                       in the South Pacific.  The kinda
                       money we'll have'll carry us a long
                       way down there.

                                  FABIAN
                       So if we wanted, we could live in
                       Bora Bora?

                                  BUTCH
                       You betcha.  And if after awhile
                       you don't dig Bora Bora, then we
                       can move over to Tahiti or Mexico.
                       
                                  FABIAN
                       But I do not speak Spanish.

                                  BUTCH
                       You don't speak Bora Boran either.
                       Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde
                       esta el zapataria?

                                  FABIAN
                       What does that mean?

                                  BUTCH
                       Where's the shoe store?

                                  FABIAN
                       Donde esta el zapataria?

                                  BUTCH
                       Excellent pronunciation.  You'll be
                       my little mama ceta in no time.

        Butch exits the bathroom.  We stay on FAbian as she brushes
        her teeth.

        Butch keeps on from the other room.

                                  BUTCH (OS)
                       Que hora es?

                                  FABIAN
                       Que hora es?

                                  BUTCH (OS)
                       What time is it?

                                  FABIAN
                       What time is it?

                                  BUTCH (OS)
                       Time for bed.  Sweet dream,
                       jellybean.

        Fabian brushes her teeth.  We watch her for a moment or two,
        then she remember something.

                                  FABIAN
                       Butch.

        She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to
        find him sound asleep in bed.

        She looks at him for a moment.

                                  FABIAN
                       Forget it.

        She exits frame, going back in the bathroom.  WE STAY on the
        WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK

        FADE UP:

46.     MOTEL ROOM - MORNING                                            46.

        SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning.  We find Butch still
        asleep in bed.

        Fabian brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom
        so she can watch TV at the same time.  She still wears the
        terry cloth robe from the night before.

        ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a bunch of Hell's Angels are taking
        on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS."

        Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing
        him.  His start startles Fabian.

                                  FABIAN
                       Merde!  You startled me.  Did you
                       have a bad dream?

        Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to
        focus.

                                  BUTCH
                       ...yeah...are you still brushing
                       your teeth?

                                  FABIAN
                       This is me.  I brush my teeth all
                       night long and into the early
                       morning.  Do you think I have a
                       problem?

        Fabian goes back into the bathroom to spit.

        If that was supposed to be sarcasm, it was lost on Butch at
        this early hour.

        Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV
        Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

                                  BUTCH
                       What are you watching?

                                  FABIAN
                       A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure
                       the name.

                                  BUTCH
                       Are you watchin' it?

        Fabian enters the room.

                                  FABIAN
                       In a way.  Why?  Would you like for
                       me to switch it off?

                                  BUTCH
                       Would you please?

        She reaches over and turns off the TV.

                                  BUTCH
                       It's a little too early in the
                       morning for explosions and war.

                                  FABIAN
                       What was it about?

                                  BUTCH
                       How should I know, you were the one
                       watchin' it.

        Fabian laughs.

                                  FABIAN
                       No, imbecile, what was your dream
                       about?

                                  BUTCH
                       Oh, I...don't remember.  It's
                       really rare I remember a dream.

                                  FABIAN
                       You just woke up from it.

                                  BUTCH
                       Fabian, I'm not lying to you, I
                       don't remember.

                                  FABIAN
                       Well, let's look at the grumpy man
                       in the morning.  I didn't say you
                       were lying, it's just odd you don't
                       remember your dreams.  I always
                       remember mine.  Did you know you
                       talk in your sleep?

                                  BUTCH
                       I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
                       in my sleep?

                                  FABIAN
                       You did last night.

                                  BUTCH
                       What did I say?

        Laying on top of him.

                                  FABIAN
                       I don't know.  I couldn't
                       understand you.

        She kisses Butch.

                                  FABIAN
                       Why don't you get up and we'll get
                       some breakfast at that breakfast
                       place with the pancakes.

                                  BUTCH
                       One more kiss and I'll get up.

        Fabian gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

                                  FABIAN
                       Satisfied?

                                  BUTCH
                       Yep.

                                  FABIAN
                       Then get up, lazy bones.

        Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the
        suitcase that Fabian brought.

                                  BUTCH
                       What time is it?

                                  FABIAN
                       Almost nine in the morning.  What
                       time does our train arrive?

                                  BUTCH
                       Eleven.

        Seeing him looking at a pair of pants.

                                  FABIAN
                       Those pants are very nice.  Can you
                       wear those with that nice blue
                       shirt you have?

        He pulls a blue shirt of the suitcase.

                                  BUTCH
                       This one?

                                  FABIAN
                       That's the one.  That matches.

                                  BUTCH
                       Okay.

        He puts the cloths on.

                                  FABIAN
                       I'm gonna order a big plate of
                       blueberry pancakes with maple
                       syrup, eggs over easy, and five
                       sausages.

                                  BUTCH
                            (surprised at her
                              potential appetite)
                       Anything to drink with that?

        Butch is finished dressing.

                                  FABIAN
                            (referring to his
                              clothes)
                       Oh yes, that looks nice.  To drink,
                       a tall glass or orange juice and a
                       black cup of coffee.  After that,
                       I'm going to have a slice of pie.

        As he goes through the suitcase.

                                  BUTCH
                       Pie for breakfast?

                                  FABIAN
                       Any time of the day is a good time
                       for pie.  Blueberry pie to go with
                       the pancakes.  And on top, a thin
                       slice of melted cheese --

                                  BUTCH
                       -- where's my watch?

                                  FABIAN
                       It's there.

                                  BUTCH
                       No, it's not.  It's not here.

                                  FABIAN
                       Have you looked?

        By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

                                  BUTCH
                       Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

        He's now throwing clothes.

                                  BUTCH
                       What the fuck do you think I'm
                       doing?!  Are you sure you got it?

        Fabian can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

                                  FABIAN
                       Uhhh...yes...beside the table
                       drawer --

                                  BUTCH
                       -- on the little kangaroo.

                                  FABIAN
                       Yes, it was on your little
                       kangaroo.

                                  BUTCH
                       Well it's not here!

                                  FABIAN
                            (on the verge of tears)
                       Well it should be!

                                  BUTCH
                       Oh it most definitely should be
                       here, but it's not.  So where is
                       it?

        Fabian is crying and scared.

        Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more
        menacing.

                                  BUTCH
                       Fabian, that was my father's
                       fuckin' watch.  You know what my
                       father went through to git me that
                       watch?...I don't wanna get into it
                       right now...but he went through a
                       lot.  Now all this other shit, you
                       coulda set on fire, but I
                       specifically reminded you not to
                       forget my father's watch.  Now
                       think, did you get it?

                                  FABIAN
                       I believe so....

                                  BUTCH
                       You believe so?  You either did, or
                       you didn't, now which one is it?

                                  FABIAN
                       Then I did.

                                  BUTCH
                       Are you sure?

                                  FABIAN
                            (shaking)
                       No.

        Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

        Fabian SCREAMS and backs into a corner,

        Butch picks up the motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

        Fabian SCREAMS IN HORROR.

        Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

                                  BUTCH
                            (to Fabian)
                       No!  It's not your fault.
                            (he approached her)
                       You left it at the apartment.

        He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

        He touches her hand, she flinches.

                                  BUTCH
                       If you did leave it at the
                       apartment, it's not your fault.  I
                       had you bring a bunch of stuff.  I
                       reminded you about it, but I didn't
                       illustrate how personal the watch
                       was to me.  If all I gave a fuck
                       about was my watch, I should've
                       told you.  You ain't a mind reader.

        He kisses her hand.  Then rises.

        Fabian is still sniffling.

        Butch goes to the closet.

                                  FABIAN
                       I'm sorry.

        Butch puts on his high school jacket.

                                  BUTCH
                       Don't be.  It just means I won't be
                       able to eat breakfast with you.

                                  FABIAN
                       Why does it mean that?

                                  BUTCH
                       Because I'm going back to my
                       apartment to get my watch.

                                  FABIAN
                       Won't the gangsters be looking for
                       you there?

                                  BUTCH
                       That's what I'm gonna find out.  If
                       they are, and I don't think I can
                       handle it, I'll split.

        Rising from the floor.

                                  FABIAN
                       My darling, I don't want you to be
                       murdered over a silly watch.

                                  BUTCH
                       One, it's not a silly watch.  Two,
                       I'm not gonna be murdered.  And
                       three, don't be scared.  I won't
                       let anything get in the way of us
                       living a happy life together.

        Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

                                  BUTCH
                       Don't feel bad, sugar pop.  Nothing
                       you could ever do would make me
                       permanently angry at you.
                            (pause)
                       I love you, remember?
                            (he digs some money out
                              of his wallet)
                       Now here's some money, order those
                       pancakes and have a great
                       breakfast.

                                  FABIAN
                       Don't go.

                                  BUTCH
                       I'll be back before you can say,
                       blueberry pie.

                                  FABIAN
                       Blueberry pie.

                                  BUTCH
                       Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
                       Okay?  Okay?

                                  FABIAN
                       Okay.

        He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

                                  BUTCH
                       Bye-bye, sugar pop.

                                  FABIAN
                       Bye.

                                  BUTCH
                       I'm gonna take your Honda.

                                  FABIAN
                       Okay.

        And with that, he's out the door.

        Fabian sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.


47.     INT. HONDA (MOVING) - DAY                                       47.

        Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his
        fists as he drives down the street.

                                  BUTCH
                       Of all the fuckin' things she
                       coulda forgot, she forgets my
                       father's watch.  I specifically
                       reminded her not to forget it.
                       "Bedside table -- on the kangaroo."
                       I said the words: "Don't forget my
                       father's watch."


48.     EXT. CITY STREET - DAY                                          48.

        The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as its
        little engine will take it.


49.     INT. HONDA (MOVING) - DAY                                       49.

        Butch continues:

                                  BUTCH
                       What the fuck am I doin'?  Have I
                       taken one too many hits to the
                       head?  That's gotta be it.  Brain
                       damage is the only excuse for this
                       dumb a move.  Stop the car, Butch.
                            (he keeps on driving)
                       Stop the car, Butch.
                            (he pays no attention
                              to himself)
                       Butch, I'm talkin' to you.  Put-
                       your-foot-on-the-break!

        Butch's foot SLAMS down hard on the break.


50.     EXT. CITY STREET - DAY                                          50.

        The little Honda SKIDS to a stop in the middle of the street.
        Butch HOPS out of the car like it was on fire.

        Butch begins PACING back and forth, talking to himself,
        oblivious to PASSERSBY and traffic.

                                  BUTCH
                       I ain't gonna do this.  This is a
                       punchy move and I ain't punchy!
                       Daddy would totally fuckin'
                       understand.  If he was here right
                       now, he'd say, "Butch, git a grip.
                       It's a fuckin' watch, man.  You
                       lose one, ya git another.  This is
                       your life you're fuckin' around
                       with, which you shouldn't be doin'
                       'cause you only got one.

        Butch continues to pace, but now he's silent.  Then....

                                  BUTCH
                       This is my war.  You see, Butch,
                       what you're forgettin' is this
                       watch isn't just a device that
                       enables you to keep track of time.
                       This watch is a symbol.  It's a
                       symbol of how your father, and his
                       father before him, and his father
                       before him, distinguished
                       themselves in war.  And when I took
                       Marsellus Wallace's money, I
                       started a war.  This is my World
                       War Two.  That apartment in North
                       Hollywood, that's my Wake Island.
                        In fact, if you look at it that
                       way, it's almost kismet that Fabian
                       left it behind.  And using that
                       perspective, going back for it
                       isn't stupid.  It may be dangerous,
                       but it's not stupid.  Because there
                       are certain things in this world
                       that are worth going back for.

        That's it, Butch has talked himself into it again.  He HOPS in
        the car, starts it up and TAKES OFF.

                                                        CUT TO:

        A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow
        pointing at one hour.


51.     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER - DAY                            51.

        Butch isn't completely reckless.  He has parked his car a
        couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
        he goes boppin' through the front door.


52.     EXT. ALLEY - DAY                                                52.

        Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
        then he discreetly glances out.


53.     EXT. STREET - BUTCH'S APARTMENT - DAY                           53.

        Everything seems normal.  More or less the right number of
        cars in the street.  None of the parked cars appear out of
        place.  None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
        Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
        Butch's home.

        Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

                                  BUTCH
                            (to himself)
                       Everything looks hunky dorie.
                       Looks can be deceiving, but this
                       time I don't think they are.  Why
                       waste the manpower to stake out my
                       place.  I'd have to be a fuckin'
                       idiot to come back here.  That's
                       how you're gonna beat 'em Butch,
                       they keep underestimating you.

        Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything.  He
        crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

        Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
        combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant.  A big sign
        sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a
        graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.


54.     EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD - DAY                          54.

        Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
        building.  Once again, everything appears normal -- the
        laundry room, the pool, his apartment door -- nothing appears
        disturbed.

        Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.
        He steps outside the door and listens inside.  Nothing.

        Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
        it.


55.     INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT - DAY                                    55.

        His apartment hasn't been touched.

        He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick
        look around.  Obviously, no one is there.

        Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the
        refrigerator.  He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from
        it.

        With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment.  Then he
        goes to the bedroom.

        His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment -- neat, clean
        and anonymous.  The only things personal in his room are a few
        boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of
        "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry
        Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

        Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: on
        the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

        He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen.  He
        opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts.  Putting
        down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and
        puts them in the toaster.

        Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

        What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with
        a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

                                  BUTCH
                            (softly)
                       Holy shit.

        He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponary and examines
        it.

        Then...a toilet FLUSHES.

        Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the
        kitchen.  There is someone behind it.

        Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not
        knowing what to do.

        The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
        bathroom, tightening his belt.  In his hand is the book
        "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

        Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

        Vincent freezes.

        Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's
        direction.

        Neither man opens his mouth.

        Then...the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

        That's all the situation needed.

        Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

        MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

        Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
        SIMULTANEOUSLY -- LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him
        through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door at
        the end of the bathroom.

        By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent
        is annihilated.

        Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened.  His look
        goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
        Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

        With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61
        back on the kitchen counter.

        Then he exits the apartment, quickly.


56.     EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - DAY                                  56.

        Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the
        courtyard....

        ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street....

        ...goes through the alley....

        ...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.


57.     EXT. HONDA - DAY                                                57.

        Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away.  The big wide
        smile of a survivor breaks across his face.


58.     EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET - DAY                            58.

        The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his
        apartment building.


59.     INT. HONDA - DAY                                                59.

        Butch looks out the window at his former home.

                                  BUTCH
                       That's how you're gonna beat 'em,
                       Butch.  They keep underestimatin'
                       ya.

        This makes the boxer laugh out loud.  As he laughs, he flips a
        tape in the cassette player.  When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS
        along with it.

        He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the
        corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

        Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we
        see:

        THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
        the big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,
        carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups
        of coffee.  He steps off the curb, crossing the street in
        front of Butch's car.  This is the first time we see Marsellus
        clearly.

        Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front
        of him.

        When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances
        to his left, sees Butch, continues walking...then STOPS!

        DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

        Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.
        He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

        The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts
        and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

        Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold
        Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending
        it up on the sidewalk.

        Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at
        one time was Fabian's Honda.  Blood flows from his nostrils.
        The still-functional tape player continues to play.  A
        PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

                                  PEDESTRIAN
                       Jesus, are you okay?

        Butch look at him, spaced-out.

                                  BUTCH
                       I guess.

        Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street.  GAWKERS
        gather around the body.

                                  GAWKER #1
                            (to the others)
                       He's dead!  He's dead!

        This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

        TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

        The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

                                  GAWKER #2
                       If you need a witness in court,
                       I'll be glad to help.  He was a
                       drunken maniac.  He hit you and
                       crashed into that car.

                                  MARSELLUS
                            (still incoherent)
                       Who?

                                  GAWKER #2
                            (pointing at Butch)
                       Him.

        Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge
        down the street, looking a shambles.

                                  MARSELLUS
                       Well, I'll be damned.

        The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back
        away.  Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

        Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward
        him.

                                  BUTCH
                       Sacre bleu.

        Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,
        shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

        He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip.  She falls to the
        ground, screaming.

                                  LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
                       Oh my God, I've been shot!

        That's all Butch needs to see.  He's outta here.

        Marsellus RUNS after him.

        The CROWD looks agape.

        Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

        The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

        Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a
        sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP."


60.     INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP - DAY                                 60.

        MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter of
        his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch
        RACES into his world.

                                  MAYNARD
                       Can I help you wit' somethin'?

                                  BUTCH
                       Shut up!

        Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next
        to the door.

                                  MAYNARD
                       Now you just wait one goddamn
                       minute --

        Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.
        He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist
        in Marsellus' face.

        The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man
        FALLS FLAT on his back.

        Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

        Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in
        the face.

        Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold
        of his middle finger.

                                  BUTCH
                       So you like chasing people, huh?

        He BREAKS the finger.  Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch
        then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS back
        the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield
        the splatter.

                                  BUTCH
                       Well guess what, big man, you
                       caught me --

                                  MAYNARD (OS)
                       -- hold it right there, godammit!

        Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a
        pump-action shotgun, aimed at the two men.

                                  BUTCH
                       Look mister, this ain't any of your
                       business --

                                  MAYNARD
                       -- I'm makin' it my business!  Now
                       toss that gun!

        Butch does.

                                  MAYNARD
                       Now you on top, stand up and come
                       to the counter.

        Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter.  As soon as he
        gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face
        with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

        After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the
        counter and moves to the telephone.

        Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily
        watches the pawnshop owner dial a number.  Maynard waits on
        the line while the other end rings.  Then it picks up.

                                  MAYNARD
                       Zed?  It's Maynard.  The spider
                       just caught a coupl'a flies.

        Marsellus passes out.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK

        FADE UP:

61.     INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM - DAY                                   61.

        TWO SHOT - BUTCH AND MARSELLUS
        are tied up in two separate chairs.  In their mouths are two
        S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and a
        little red ball sticks in their mouths).  Both men are
        unconscious.  Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and
        SPRAYS both guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters.
        The two prisoners look up at their captors.

        Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one
        hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in his
        belt.

                                  MAYNARD
                       Nobody kills anybody in my place of
                       business except me or Zed.

        A BUZZER buzzes.

                                  MAYNARD
                       That' Zed.

        Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs that
        lead to red curtains and goes through them.

        WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed
        inside the store.

        Butch and Marsellus look around the room.  The basement of the
        pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon.  After taking in
        their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, all
        traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share
        at what they've gotten themselves into.

        Maynard and ZED come through the curtains.  Zed is an even
        more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.
        The two hillbillys are obviously brothers.  Where Maynard is a
        vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra.  Zed walks in and
        stands in front of the two captives.  He inspects them for a
        long time, then says:

                                  ZED
                            (to Maynard)
                       You said you waited for me?

                                  MAYNARD
                       I did.

                                  ZED
                       Then how come they're all beat up?

                                  MAYNARD
                       They did that to each other.  They
                       was fightin' when they came in.
                       This one was gonna shoot that one.

                                  ZED
                            (to Butch)
                       You were gonna shoot him?

        Butch makes no reply.

                                  ZED
                       Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in
                       front of this place?

                                  MAYNARD
                       Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

                                  ZED
                       No, it's Thursday.

                                  MAYNARD
                       Then she'll be fine.

                                  ZED
                       Bring out The Gimp.

                                  MAYNARD
                       I think The Gimp's asleep.

                                  ZED
                       Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em
                       up then, won't you?

        Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

                                  MAYNARD
                            (yelling in the hole)
                       Wake up!

        Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a
        leash.  He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor,
        rises THE GIMP.

        The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black
        leather bondage gear.  There are zippers, buckles and studs
        here and there on the body.  On his head is a black leather
        mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.
        They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large
        dog.

        Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,
        then lowers into it.  Maynard hands

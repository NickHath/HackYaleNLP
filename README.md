# Natural Language Processing in Python
Welcome to the course page for HackYale's Natural Language Processing in Python. We'll be covering basic corpus manipulation, word tokenization and text classification tasks using Python's popular Natural Language Toolkit. I'll be posting all of my slides and code samples here, as well as links to interesting NLP articles and resources.
